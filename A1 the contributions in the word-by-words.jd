The first word-by-word wasn't tracked very particularly.

The second word-by-word was 2025-11-05. Here are some colored pictures about it:

The second picture is notes jotted down to maybe become part of the story.

The colored text indicates who typed something, which is usually but not always who came up with it.

remark by M:

(context: during the composition, C wanted to turn the "had" M had chosen (on the first line of prose) into "hadn't". There were no firm rules for this at that point[^¹], so M said "yes, if you separate them with a hyphen".)

[^¹]: later they stopped writing spaces after their words to purposefully allow for more of this tomfoolery

Honestly I should have written that hyphen so that it would show up in my color, since I was just giving orders. Oh well!

(context: "I was just giving orders", a reference to the Nuremberg defense, is a joke that M is fond of, which joke perhaps has been invented multiple independent times, in this case perhaps by a friend.)

2025-12-21

Later, there may be more...! unless we've already finished by the time you read this.
