The beach detective stood aloof in the middle of the floor of the morning commuter transport ship[^ship] headed to the flying island. He held no seat nor structure to steady himself against the shudders and turbulence of the ride; he just stood firm. He was surrounded by the peasants, of various stripes and qualities, of the flying island, which — despite freemen and free agents — were some reason called villeins. The Flying Villeins. 97% of the population. And here he was among them, vagabone, vagābundus. But he paid them no mind. Instead, he looked out at the beautiful bright gently-churning ocean, under the indefatigable and undefiable[$undefyable?] Sun that precluded him from looking at half of his possible field of vision. He thought about what the old man had told him the previous time he had been on an assignment to the flying island Skoios[^pronunciation]:

[^ship]: This amphibious sea- and then air- ship[@ it goes on the sea a while and then takes off into the air to get to the island] was called an aeroömnibus; or "’bus", for short.[$ Or "aerō omnia vincit" for long.[@A play on "labor omnia vincit"/"amor omnia vincit" ("work conquers all"/"love conquers all"), this other version actually means "a wicker basket binds up all" (a vinciō/vincō pun). Evidently, they don't think much of this ship!][$"Omnia mea mecum porto"[@ this is a famous latin expression, meaning "All that is mine I carry with me", which is kind of a pun in this context since the since actually carries a lot.], the ship would have said if it could talk, which it cannot.][@Something something _Porko Rosso_, porto meacum...]

[^pronunciation]: The beach detective tended to pronounce this name /sko.i.os/ [skow.ij.ows]; the old man pronounced it /skoj.os/ [skɔj.əws]; the natives of said island tend to pronounce it /sko.i.os/ [sko.i.os] these days[$although, oddly, they didn't tend to pronounce any other vowels in such a non-english style.] although some old-timers still held to the pronunciation /ski.os/ [ski.os]. Thomas Metcalf pronounced it /sko.i.os/ [skɐw.ij.ɐws].

Lars Squiggle had just finished telling him a long story about how he had turned, from his islandish youth, to Continentalism. The beach butler brought another cup of tea. Then:

"Only I and other old monsters finally understand virtue," said Lars, "instead of a confusèd morass of vague associations."

"Virtue, hmm?" said the beach detective.

"Virtue is the disposition to do the good," said Lars. "But what is the good? It may surprise you. Sometimes the few must die to save the many. And sometimes the many must die for the few."

"Mirth and Succession," quipped the beach detective.

"Indeed," said Lars. "And only those steeped in time and wisdom can truly understand the path to the good, the way around the trick knives of this unholy world, the unintuitive intuitions that bear[$or perhaps he had said "bare"] the birth of the better world."

"Yeah, I don't really go for that," said the beach detective.

"Fate often has interesting plans us," said Lars, "Even those of us who don't feel privy to the machinations of its fingers... you may be one such..."

And after that time, the beach detective had left the old man on the beautiful beach, and had completed an assignment on the flying island, of no particular consequence, and had returned to the continents, and had continued to spend all his money on fast women and fine booze — or at least quick women and good booze —, and all was well, more or less. No particular plan from fate seemed to lie in his future. Which was just as well to him.

He grappled with the urge to wreak vengeance from time to time, but mostly overcame it. There would be so many to be venged upon; it would be a big hassle. Frankly, it was above his pay grade. Although, he did dream of cosmic justice.

He took his gaze from the sunny scene and regarded the object in his hands. His investigations notebook, a black pleather covered number with his notes inside scrawled in a cramped Gregg shorthand. It was open to a page about three quarters of the way through the book, the current page, and the two-page spread was nearly black with his scribblings. The beach detective only used the notes as a cue, an aide-mémoire. His mind kept all the details of an investigation like an iron trap. For whatever reason, his mind wouldn't let him forget them.

That's not to say that all of his investigations were successful. The Beach Detective often thought of investigations in the terms of the Tide. The tide goes in and the tide goes out. Despite foolish proclamations to the contrary, no man can turn the tide. You'd have to be God.

The beach detective closed his notebook and returned it to his interior jacket pocket.

He met the gaze of a man %% who did not look away.

Thick black glasses, and oddly protrudinous nose, and a big black mustache that differed significantly in color from his beard.

The sun, the eyes of Term J. Michaelmas & God. [@ this is a Great Gatsby reference, and also a callback to the previous chapter ~M] %%

%% asking him on a date?

"My name?" said the stranger. He paused, clearly coming up with a lie. "Marvinlust Maoi. At your service! Mwahaha!"

"OK," said the beach detective.

"Don't eat cheeses around me-ses — if you pleases! Hee hee (ses)!" ~~ses~~ ~~says~~ said the mysterious stranger, enamored with his new name. He smiled self-satisfièdly. "Do you need any pills?" he offered.

"No," said the beach detective.
