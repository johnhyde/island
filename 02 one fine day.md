Thomas Metcalf woke up on January 1ˢᵗ with an image of death before him. The image was an abstract premonition, not a visual hallucination — although he had those as well from time to time. He immediately knew that it would be a year of death, but what did that mean? He knew better than to worry, but it caused him to wonder greatly nonetheless. He didn’t really want to die, nor did he wish to see any of his friends, family, or even enemies die. He pondered the matter over breakfast in the motel cafeteria. He wasn’t quite his usual self, but it didn’t slow him down at all. As usual, he had no plans and a slight sense of urgency, so after he finished his meal he stopped by the kitchen to thank the cooks and headed right out the door.

It was a fine spring morning, just warm enough that he was comfortable in his short-sleeved shirt (as long as he maintained a brisk pace, which he did). He caught a whiff of the Pacific from his left, and turned right at the next intersection. He continued on, past quaint, lifeless shops, and then past pleasant old homes. He saw a large tree at a corner, and the crack it had put in the sidewalk, and turned left. He wasn’t at all familiar with this town; he was navigating purely by instinct, going “whither the whim,” as he would say. It never let him down.

After a block, he noticed a peculiar situation on his left. The house was dark, but the gate in the fence and the front door had been left wide open. He was halfway up the porch steps before he stopped himself. He stopped and thought for a moment, shook his head and laughed to himself, and turned around to continue on his way. A red herring. Sometimes he would see something that seemed like an obvious Invitation, a clear Next Step, which was actually irrelevant. If he’d been paying closer attention he would have known immediately that he had no business in that house, but distracted as he was by thoughts of Death, he had jumped to conclusions.

Now he was speed-walking to make up lost time and get Back On Track. It was crucial to stay On Track, and when he got Off Track, his first priority was always to get Back On Track. A few seconds here and there wasn’t a big deal, as long as nothing was Meant to Happen in those seconds, and he was able to make it up before the Next Step. He thought of himself as an extra in a complex action sequence, or a robot in an assembly line, or an electron in a microchip (although his understanding of electricity was at best rudimentary). He had to be in the right place at the right time, and do the right thing, to stay On Track.

After about 22 seconds of walking at 150% his normal speed, he relaxed. Back On Track. An easy fix, but he had to be more careful. It wasn’t always as simple as walking a bit faster. He looked around brightly, and saw a couple cop cars parked on the street, again to his left. Hello hello! He outwardly assumed a sombre attitude and countenance, and approached at more casual pace. Here was an Invitation; the first of the day and not a small one.

“Sorry, sir, you can’t come in here, this is a crime scene,” said the police officer who was putting up the crime scene tape. What he lacked in height and facial symmetry he made up for with his full, kempt beard and genuinely sympathetic tone. “Please, what’s going on? My friend lives here, and I’m worried about her.” Thomas was shocked. He practically never lied, and in this case it seemed both rash and unnecessary. But it didn’t feel off—no, he could tell he was still On Track, as the policeman’s eyes widened and he cleared his throat.

“Sir, I’m very sorry to say that your friend is dead,” the policeman said, “Or at least we think she is—I mean we know she’s dead but we don’t know if she lived here. We just got here and we haven’t had time to get the full picture.”

Thomas didn’t react. He didn’t know what to do or say, so he just tried to look stunned, which he was.

“If I could get your name and contact information, sir, I’m sure the detectives would like to ask you some questions at some point.” He solemnly produced a pen and notepad and looked at Thomas expectantly.

It wasn’t often that Thomas found himself in a critical situation without any idea what to do, but it happened from time to time, and this was one such time. It was a cold, empty feeling and he hoped it would go away soon. He improvised: “May I see her? Perhaps it’s not my friend after all, or perhaps I’ve got the wrong house…” As soon as he said it, he regretted it, the part about the wrong house. He knew this was the right house, for some value of “right”.

“I don’t know, sir, it’s not a pretty sight…”

“I used to drive an ambulance, I’m sure I can take it,” Thomas lied again. He was getting desperate, and he couldn’t tell whether he was On Track or not.

“I’ll ask.” The police officer ducked under the tape into the building. Thomas looked around the immediate neighborhood from the small porch of the house. Middle income, decently well maintained, unselfconscious lawns, some displays of liberal ideology posted here and there. The weather was just about perfect.

“You can come in, sir.” Thomas turned around, and followed Officer Waters into the house. He had a feeling his name was Waters.
