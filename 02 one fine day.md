Thomas Metcalf woke up on January 1ˢᵗ with an image of death before him. The image was an abstract premonition, not a visual hallucination — although he had those as well from time to time. He immediately knew that it would be a year of death, but what did that mean? He knew better than to worry, but it caused him to wonder greatly nonetheless. He didn’t really want to die, nor did he wish to see any of his friends, family, or even enemies die. He pondered the matter over breakfast in the motel cafeteria. He wasn’t quite his usual self, but it didn’t slow him down at all. As usual, he had no plans and a slight sense of urgency, so after he finished his meal he stopped by the kitchen to thank the cooks and headed right out the door.

It was a fine spring morning, just warm enough that he was comfortable in his short-sleeved shirt (as long as he maintained a brisk pace, which he did). He caught a whiff of the Pacific from his left, and turned right at the next intersection. He continued on, past quaint, lifeless shops, and then past pleasant old homes. He saw a large tree at a corner, and the crack it had put in the sidewalk, and turned left. He wasn’t at all familiar with this town; he was navigating purely by instinct, going “whither the whim,” as he would say. It never let him down.

After a block, he noticed a peculiar situation on his left. The house was dark, but the gate in the fence and the front door had been left wide open. He was halfway up the porch steps before he stopped himself. He stopped and thought for a moment, shook his head and laughed to himself, and turned around to continue on his way. A red herring. Sometimes he would see something that seemed like an obvious Invitation, a clear Next Step, which was actually irrelevant. If he’d been paying closer attention he would have known immediately that he had no business in that house, but distracted as he was by thoughts of Death, he had jumped to conclusions.

Now he was speed-walking to make up lost time and get Back On Track. It was crucial to stay On Track, and when he got Off Track, his first priority was always to get Back On Track. A few seconds here and there wasn’t a big deal, as long as nothing was Meant to Happen in those seconds, and he was able to make it up before the Next Step. He thought of himself as an extra in a complex action sequence, or a robot in an assembly line, or an electron in a microchip (although his understanding of electricity was at best rudimentary). He had to be in the right place at the right time, and do the right thing, to stay On Track.

After about 22 seconds of walking at 150% his normal speed, he relaxed. Back On Track. An easy fix, but he had to be more careful. It wasn’t always as simple as walking a bit faster. He looked around brightly, and saw a couple cop cars parked on the street, again to his left. Hello hello! He outwardly assumed a sombre attitude and countenance, and approached at more casual pace. Here was an Invitation; the first of the day and not a small one.

“Sorry, sir, you can’t come in here, this is a crime scene,” said the police officer who was putting up the crime scene tape. What he lacked in height and facial symmetry he made up for with his full, kempt beard and genuinely sympathetic tone. “Please, what’s going on? My friend lives here, and I’m worried about her.” Thomas was shocked. He practically never lied, and in this case it seemed both rash and unnecessary. But it didn’t feel off—no, he could tell he was still On Track, as the policeman’s eyes widened and he cleared his throat.

“Sir, I’m very sorry to say that your friend is dead,” the policeman said, “Or at least we think she is—I mean we know she’s dead but we don’t know if she lived here. We just got here and we haven’t had time to get the full picture.”

Thomas didn’t react. He didn’t know what to do or say, so he just tried to look stunned, which he was.

“If I could get your name and contact information, sir, I’m sure the detectives would like to ask you some questions at some point.” He solemnly produced a pen and notepad and looked at Thomas expectantly.

It wasn’t often that Thomas found himself in a critical situation without any idea what to do, but it happened from time to time, and this was one such time. It was a cold, empty feeling and he hoped it would go away soon. He improvised: “May I see her? Perhaps it’s not my friend after all, or perhaps I’ve got the wrong house…” As soon as he said it, he regretted it, the part about the wrong house. He knew this was the right house, for some value of “right”.

“I don’t know, sir, it’s not a pretty sight…”

“I used to drive an ambulance, I’m sure I can take it,” Thomas lied again. He was getting desperate, and he couldn’t tell whether he was On Track or not.

“I’ll ask.” The police officer ducked under the tape into the building. Thomas looked around the immediate neighborhood from the small porch of the house. Middle income, decently well maintained, unselfconscious lawns, some displays of liberal ideology posted here and there. The weather was just about perfect.

“You can come in, sir.” Thomas turned around, and followed Officer Waters into the house. He had a feeling his name was Waters.

Thomas felt nauseous when he looked upon the body. Not because he minded[^mund] the sight of viscera; he had long since gotten used to that. The body looked like a human being who had forgotten to remain alive, or a barbecue some ogre had forgotten to make. A simple thing, death. When the inside part become outside parts the inside spirit gets out as well. No — this nausea came from the vagus nerve, and it twinged when he touched the nerve of the Track in the deepest way possible, although even in this way he had only ever grazed it, glancing by, as was his station as a bit player in life and one of God's merest million billion messengers. He retched once out of reflex but recovered immediately.

"I'm sorry you had to see this, sir," said Officer Waters, eyeing him with great gentleness. "Take your time. But it would be helpful to us to know if you know this individual. Once you've taken a minute.

Thomas nodded. His head was swimming, but he was only resting in the pretense of being taken-aback. "Individual, yet so easily divode," he said, by way of reply.

"What?" asked Waters.

"Divided?" Thomas corrected himself, unsure.

"What?" asked Waters.

At this time, another police officer entered the room. From his bearing, Thomas could tell he was the senior in the partnership. A real man-about-town. If the town, was downtown.[^downtown] Perfect. Just the man Thomas wanted to see. He was now realizing. Thomas straightened up and offered his hand to the man, who was deftly stepping over various dismembered members strewn about. They exchanged a firm, but tender handshake. One could even dare say loving.[^love]

Thomas was about to say something, and seemed like it, but for some reason he was blanking on the name of this cop, which he had been planning to spring on him as a surprise. It was a highly variable strategy, but on good days Thomas found that people were often impressed if you could guess their names before being introduced. He didn't understand it, himself; to him, his own name was the most unsurprising fact in the world.

"Hello, son," said the officer, greeting Thomas with a figure of speech, as he was significantly older than Thomas. "I'm sorry you had to see all this."

"Yeah, well..." said Thomas. "I was just talking to... Officer... Baba, here—" he saw from the reaction of officer Waters, out of the corner of his eyes, the slight widening of the eyes in surprise, that he had guess said officer's first name correct. On Track!— "about this... horrible incident."

The older cop nodded. "Such a shame, such a shame."

"I'm Thomas Metcalf, Intuitive Detective," said Thomas Metcalf, Intuitive Detective. ("On Track", he said to himself, afterwards, the way you might say "Esquire".)

The older cop raised his eyebrows. "Something of a detective, too, huh? Well. I'm Blarte Canche, Malle[^malle] Cop." ("Call Mop", added Thomas to himself. "Call ‘m Up", he apappended, savoring the backwards apostrophe.) "And this here is my partner, Baba Waters, whom I ascertain you have already met."

Officer Waters was still too confused by Thomas' parlor trick to comment. He began to look down at his badge, to double-check that it only had his last name on it like he thought.

"Baba, I found the vic's purse in the other room," said Blarte. "There was an identity card in there. Face matches. This woman seems to have lived here; the address matches up. Her name was Mai Friend."

"What the—?" said Waters. "How the—?..."

Thomas received another tingle from the vagus nerve, this one a slight tickling sensation. "Curious," he muttered.

All three of them looked down at the body again, for their own individual — but similar — reasons. The body looked like it had been in the center of an explosion, but a very precises one, that tore through the body like a vivisection, although one apparently at random.

"The gumshoes will be through here later, but there doesn't seem to be any sign of a struggle," said Blarte. "It's like she was taken by surprise and the perp did it in an instant."

"Or maybe she new the perp and this is a kind of assisted suicide situation," offered Waters.

"Or maybe her body just did that," mused Thomas.

The other two looked at him incredulously. But he was still looking down at the body. The pattern of cuts reminded him of something, deep in his blood memory.

Thomas straightened up his neck to look at his two new friends again. He suddenly felt the Track had resolved, and its direction was outward. "Well, gentlemen," he commented. "I shall see you later. I've given you my name, and my current residence is the Dukesberg Motel & Inn. I have no doubt — although I could not tell you why — that our paths will cross on this investigation again. Adieu." And so he left.

Later, eating lunch at a cafe, Thomas spotted a newspaper headline on the paper held by another patron of the same establishment:

> Reginald ***Metcalf*** Digsxby vanishes!

Subhead:

> Digsxby family fortune thrown into legal uncertainty!

The word "Metcalf" was bolded and italicized. It was very strange.

Thomas left his lunch to get cold — not very considerate of the Track, he thought idly — and popped over to the newsstand to purchase a copy of the Flying Island Tribune. Which paper he had just seen. "Sorry, sir," apologized the whelp tending the stand, "beggin' your pardon but we've just run out of that. Even our display copy. Seeing as how this Digskby thing is the crime of the century. If you wait another 15 minutes we might get another restock come by."

"There's no time for that," said Thomas, feeling there was no time for that. "I'll take whatever other paper you have," he continued, scrimbing his hands.[^scrimb]

"Alright," said the shopchild. "But I warn you: the Flying Island Times went to press too early and they don't have any coverage of the Digsxby Occurrence.

"Whatever," said Thomas, sort of confused by his own inspecificity at pursuing the ostensible object of his desire.

The shopcritter handed him a copy of today's Times for a tuppence. Thomas left the stand and looked at the front page. Yep. No coverage of Digsxby at all, nor anyone else with the name "Metcalf" anywhere in their name, either. Instead, the headline news of the Times today was

> Some schmuck hit by martini glass, dies

They didn't even have a picture of the man. Just a drawing of a martini glass. It wasn't even a picture of the martini glass. Wait a minute.

Thomas stopped dead in his tracks. The martini glass. That pattern. That was the shape that was cut out of the body!

[^mund]: mund?
[^downtown]: as in "we're taking you downtown" ie to the police station for questioning
[^love]: It was love at first shake.
[^malle]: Malle Cop is the old-fashioned title for the senior type of cop, in this town
[^scrimb]: to scrimb your hands is to open and close them with a somewhat anxious subanticipation, like a man searching for his keys or a carnivorous animal chittering its teeth. Somewhat similar to the "bribe me" gesture.
