"It's horrible," detective Georgia Mann said to her husband Florida Mann. "Wright Heare has been killed!"

Ten minutes and six hours prior, twenty minutes after the killing, the beach detective leaned over the body he had discovered. *Poor sod,* he thought. He went through the body's pockets. An identification document. *Wright Heare? More like Wwrong... place wrong time. Heh. Nice one.* A folded folder[$ It was extra folded, more fold for your folder.]. He took it. For some reason, a martini glass had been drawn on it, in the exact square of paper that was face-up and towards him as he took it out of the pocket. It was a really nice ink sketch, actually. He unfolded the wad of paper and rapidly flicked through. Something about some guy named "Martin Eeny". Whatever. He pocketed it. He continued to search the body, but found nothing of interest. Besides, of course, the unconventional pattern of destruction of the body, which he had already noted.
