"Hey," said the man standing in the mouth of the alley. "Looking for me?"

Sensation and menace rolled off the man like waves, in Thomas's[@ The rule I use regarding a name ending with s rendered into the possessive is that if I would *say*, eg, "Jesuses shoes" I write "Jesus's shoes" and if I would *say* "Jesus shoes" I write "Jesus' shoes". It just makes sense. (incidentally: I think of both as grammatically correct, and so both can be used, and you can even go back and forth between them based on whim) ~M] sympathetic sea of a nervous system[@ this is a mention of the sympathetic nervous system, which controls fight-or-flight ~M]. According to the portents of the Track, this was the most significant man he could possibly have met at the moment. In a bad way.

The man was of about average height. He wore a black lounge suit. Under his black fedora, he had semi-long hair that went back instead of forwards, and framed his smallish ears beautifully. He wore tiny, thick spectacles. He had a small pin in the shape of a martini on his lapel. He was holding things made of metal and glass in his hands. His black shoes clicked gently as he slowly walked towards Thomas. His face wore an unnerving grin.

Thomas was only able to gape at him. Awed. Deer-in-headlits[$ deer-in-heads-lits, some might say].

"Shaken? Don't stir," the man said. [@ This line was regarded as quite good by the other authors. It is a reference to — a pun upon, even — the famous way that James Bond orders his martini. ~M]

He drew closer.

"How... how did you find me?" Thomas asked.

"How, indeed?" the man mused, rhetorically.

Thomas got a hold of himself and stared intently into the eyes of the man, willing the Track to tell him something — anything.

The Martini Killer.

The Martini Killer!

The Martini Killer drew closer. Thomas had been involuntarily walking backwards, trying to get away. He was at the wall now. He bumped into it, then pressed himself into it. Repelled as though by a force from the man in front of him.

Thomas cast[$ cust?] about for a weapon, but found nothing. He stared at the man again. [@ I don't really remember if Thomas carries a gun or something but if so I guess it was lost in the lapse from the poison. ~M]

"Go ahead," said the Martini Killer. "Read me. It won't make a difference."

Martinius Kijller.[@ I came up with this guy's name after Bartimieus Ender's name was already made up (even though it occurs before "Bartimieus Ender" in the text) which is probably why his name sounds like this. ~M] 123 Malibu Lane. Childhood bedwetter. Ophthalmologist extraordinaire. Thomas had never met this guy before. He'd never even hear of him. He'd never even heard of anyone who'd heard of him.

Martinius Kijller, the martini killer, spun the glass object furiously around his fingers with the grace of a butterfly knife artist while remaining completely placid.

He was almost upon Thomas now.

Thomas' stomach lurched. *Hruck!* He threw up on Martinius's shoes.

"Well, now you've made me angry," said Martinius, calmly. "Do you know how much those shoes cost? The normal amount."

"Sorry," Thomas almost said, before remembering that this man was about to kill him. He leaned against the wall, woozily. His hand touched cold metal. *Ladder,* he thought.

With a speed never before matched, Thomas summitted the ladder and began to reverse-escape up the fire escape.

"F—" hissed the martini killer, during. He tossed the spinning glass object at Thomas with incredible speed, but missed; the glass shattered against the ladder and fell into a million pieces.

Atop the building,[@ There are fire escapes that go all the way up to the roof; I checked. ~M] Thomas looked down, with a precognitive dread. Yes, there was the martini killer, climbing up the last flight of stairs, dashing lightly on his smelly feet, towards Thomas.

"What's the rush?" asked the martini killer. "Don't you want to know what happened to your new friend?"

Thomas's heart sank.

"*Bartimieus Ender*," said the martini killer.

"Who?" said Thomas.

"That bartender at the MetCafe you were palling around with," said the martini killer, undeterred. "You know, it's ironic. He would end other Barts, but in the end... he was ended by me (a non-Bart)."

"Oh..." said Thomas. Obviously, every death of a righteous man was a tragedy, but he hadn't really come to know—— Thomas ducked. Another glass flew over his head, right through where his head had been. "Jesus," he muttered.

"You've cocked your last snook—" [@ a full exegesis of why I thought this phrase would be funny to put here will not be provided, but I will provide some additional injokes about it in an appendix. ~M]

"Huh?" said Thomas.

"—O *Tartare Detention*!" [@ martini killer is reading his nametag from far away ~M]

"Wha—?" asked Thomas. But the question was cut off, and the air cut out of his lungs, by the metal cylindrical object the martini killer had thrown at him, which was hitting his torso with the force of truck.
