Francesca ***Metcalf***[@ She took his middle name? ~M][I’m imagining they both took her maiden name as middle name ~J] Digsxby was so tired. The botched botched betrayal and it’s[sic][@ This "it’s[sic]" joke used to live in the prologue, as "before it’s[sic] time", where it was pretty clearly a reference to the previous dialogue “‘took it’s own course,’ with an apostrophe!”, until John moved it here. I just think that's interesting. ~M] consequences[@ This is a subtle reference to _Industrial Society And Its Future_~M] had been a disaster for her personally. She felt an overwhelming burden of guilt over her husband’s mysterious disappearance.[^attorney] She couldn’t really blame herself, if she was being fair. She’d done what she thought was right, and she’d arranged everything with excellence and even panache, but one spot of bad luck (or was it poor judgment?) had spoiled everything in an instant.

[^attorney]: her attorneys have advised me to maintain a certain ambiguity about why exactly this is.

Essentially, her Pookie was not supposed to have disappeared. He wasn’t even supposed to have fallen unconscious at the moment of betrayal. It would seem that Francesca had seriously underestimated the delicacy of his nerves, and for this she might never forgive herself, although even now it was hard to believe. But he _had_ fallen unconscious, and when he’d awoken he’d shocked both her and Manuel (if indeed that machine can be shocked) by launching immediately into a violent flailing, by which we must assume he hoped to attain freedom from what we must assume he assumed to be his captivity. As fate would have it, in one of his blind strikes he impaled his one hand on one of Manuel’s utility spikes.

Well, I won’t bore you with the details, but basically things got out of hand very quickly from there. In particular, a good amount of Reginald’s blood got out of his hand very quickly. But also in a general sense. It became clear that certain things[^things] would need to be done to recover any semblance of control over the situation, which things were done, which Francesca found, ultimately, very tiring.

[^things]: those pesky attorneys, I tell ya

So she was relieved when she finally found herself with a moment to let her hair down and not do anything specific for an hour.

After 15 minutes listlessly[@ lol ~J] humming to herself, throwing that around the room and rooms as always, she decided to take an inventory of the house, the flying island. She started by listing[@ not so listless anymore! ~J] to herself all of the boats that were in the house, which were named after the boats in the Iliad. Once she was done with this, she decided to take an inventory of every room of the house. There was the galley, of course. And then the galley of a different sense. And then the gallery. And so on. She passed into the morning room. Pray it would never become a mourning room — or perhaps it would... And then, of course, was the secret dungeon, in which Mr Digsxby was being kept. What was left of him,[$How much of him is left? Maybe it's all of him. Wouldn't you like to know!] so to speak. But it was not good to think of it now. It would simply lead her to distraction in this, her moment of solace and solitude, and she'd thought about it enough in the past, oh, indeterminate hours.

The hulking inanimate carapace of Manuel the big robot hulked over her. Hulk, hulk.

"Will you be needing anything, Madam?" asked Manuel, in his distinctive yet non-unpleasant robotic-toned roboty voice.

Francesca, who was sometimes called Fran to her friends or Franny to her family or 'Cesca[@ This apostrophe renders backwards, hmm. %% maybe I should just correct it to ’ manually, although I have a sort of irrational dislike of using anything but ' for an apostrophe, because that's the character which is U+0027 APOSTROPHE, dammit! However, I have done it before, and will do it again; and, in conventional typesetting, there is no typographical difference between an apostrophe and and curly close single (much to my chagrin). Anyway, even though we could fix the autocurling algorithm a little, it seems unlikely to me that we will make it smart enough to to this one right (it's legitimately ambiguous whether it's an apostrophe or a quote and you have to figure out if there's a quotation there by understanding the rules of English and/or parsing along the line for a hypothesized closing quote). Or, I suppose, we could ban autocurling of single quotes, and then it wouldn't be ambiguous. But what about the chapter where our heros enter a parody of a british novel, what then?! ~M] to her lover or sometimes for apparently no reason at all Eleanor,[@ This comma is why I didn't use any commas before now in the sentence, even though they would have been a pretty good move. ~M][@ I think about all of my linguistic choices in this much depth, although very very fast. ~M] didn't open her eyes. "There's no need to do that voice. We're alone."

"Of course, madam," said Manuel, in a distinctively non-distinctive voice.

"Oh, come off it!" said Fran, weakly throwing a small pillow at the overgrown tin can. With a *bzt, bzhrt, zhuu* noise that seemed to be produced by a human mouth, the front of the robot-suit's face-visor opened, revealing the handsomely mustached human visage of the ultimately enfleshèd Manuel Ordinator Computer Gonzalez.[@ Oh no way Manuel is enfleshèd??? ~J][@ What a twist! ~M][@ It's probably just my _homo_ bias showing. But I read the part about him singing a beautiful song about Sonic or whatever and I thought, hold on, I'm a human supremacist, that's a human type activity! ~M][@ just wait till I make Manuel Ordinator Computer Gonzalez actually just a really fancy robot that looks like a human hiding in a clunky robot suit ~J][@ Driven by a homunculus ~M]

He sat down beside her on the sofa on which she’d collapsed, awkwardly because of his carapace, and attempted to tenderly pick a stray confetto from her hair with his lever-operated robot-pincers. To distract her from the difficulty he was having with this, he said, “You know, it could be worse. All in all, it could have gone much worse.”

She sighed a deep, somewhat performative sigh. “How?”

Manuel was alternately gripping the confetto with different pairs of pincers, hoping he could stop alternately gripping her hair at some point. “Well,” he said, “the fireworks could have malfunctioned and exploded at street-level, injuring innocents, or spelled the wrong message.”

“The thing itself went about as badly as it could, though.” Franny was in a mood to argue. “The fireworks were just a bit of flair.”[$ and a lot of flare] Then she let out a squeak as Manuel finally removed the confetto, yanking a few last hairs in the process. She opened her eyes to glare at him and saw that he was working hard not to glare at her. Instead he glared at the coffee table, or perhaps at the little marble elephant thereon. Manuel wanted to say, _I put a great deal of effort into those fireworks_, but he kept his mouth shut. He heard a cute little voice coming (seemingly) from the elephant on the coffee table, saying, “What’s the matter Mr. Robot Man? Are you mad at me?”

“My apologies, Little Elephant Boy,” Manuel said in a somewhat robotic tone, “I was just calculating how much time and money I spent on a fireworks display that the user has now deemed to be unnecessary trash garbage.”

Francesca felt simultaneously the urge to apologize and comfort him and the urge to slap him upside his stupid metal head. Was he really going to be sensitive about his fireworks display right now? Her entire life was crashing down around her, and now she also had to be sensitive to his feelings? But also, she _was_ sensitive to his feelings; it was her nature to be so.

Newsflash, motherfuckers![@ I'm not so sure about swearing in this thing. Hmm. Deserves further consideration.%% ~M][@ I’d prefer not swearing, but it’s not a huge deal to me. ~J][@I have considered multiple different substitutions here, such as "good friends", "brigadiers", "brigands", and "mutineers".

“Don't go on a dirg’ piloted by that same guy,” people had seemed to say to her, and indeed in fact in deed had actually said to her verbatim, after the first time he had traumatically crashed his big ol’ sky balloon. “But,” said the twinkle in his lovably dangerous eye, “what are the odds...?”. And so she had, again, ridden the blimp again[@ Even though I say "again" twice, she only ever rode the blimp twice — or I guess maybe it only crashed twice, but she'd ridden it before? I'm not really certain. ~M], under his auspices, under the daring dare of the sparkling eye of the young and dashing Dr Michaelmas — she probably should have noticed he had at least one glass eye; that had probably been relevant — and so in a way was partially responsible for his death, as he had died then, or so they all assumed, on account of never finding the body;[@ This choice of punctuation is impugnable. However, if reading _Moby-Dick_ taught me anything, it's that semicolons do a lot more than might naïvely be imagined[$ Such as in school textbooks.].~M] and a frightfully (un)pleasant bar-be-que smell that emanated from the crash site, a naturally barren side of a mountain[@ The fact that he crashed into the side of a mountain is also part of the joke. ~M], for the next subsequent days, years, millennia.

She could only be grateful that both she and her husband had both escaped unscathed both times they had both been there. What are the odds! As a married woman, of course, she couldn't be carrying on with Dr Michaelmas like one of his so many ladyfancies and admiresses. However, she did have an emotional affair with him, she felt, which is like a regular[$ a regulair?][@ This is supposed to implicitly be an adjective that summons forth its %%] but less titillating or a friendship but more or, oddly enough, like your relationship with your priest if you have an especially cool priest. Here’s a bunch of stuff Dr Michaelmas said:

“First thing’s first, I'm unstoppable. Secondly, my heart burgeons with love for all mankind. Thirdly: I love to hold, to touch, to caress, to make love.[$ Indeed (as could be seen when he cradled his lover Enronia), he held gently and thoroughly, like a man trembling with joy at the occurrence, every brush with skin and skin or her soft, soft sweater making him beam beside himself.] Fourthly: I have plans for this earth, for its people and their embiggenment, and I wish to see them through. Fifthly: I hate artifice; do not paint your face with me[@ Eventually someone is going to notice that I consistently refer to make-up as "painted face" and then they're gonna ask "why do you do that?" and I'm going to say "well, isn't it?" and they'll go "yeah... but... ??". ~M][@ To me the very phrase "make-up" sounds childish and clownish and euphemistic and absurd — as is the practice itself. ~M]; to me a painted face is like an open wound. Sixthly: I can bench 300 pounds…”

Warmth radiated off of him like the rays of the sun, and like the sun he was almost impossible to look directly at[@ There's really not a better choice here than not having a comma, for the actual sentence I want to express (which is sort of a conceptual run-on), although some may find it jarring. ~M] he was so proverbially bright; to cast your eyes directly in[@ This preposition is bothersome. Some might even call it a grammatical error. But I think "cast upon", as you typically do with eyes, is also a contextually-dependent preposition that would suggest an incorrect physical arrangement if you did not know to interpret it in a figurative sense — albeit a slightly different one. ("Upon" strikes me as more suggestive of a figurative arrangement than "on", however. Although both can do both, in most case.) I guess many people might tell you can only cast a gaze upon, which is literally correct as well (I guess. What is the physical extension of a gaze? Whatever you see I guess.). So, anyway, I think casting your eyes in or into his is a legitimate way to describe looking into his eyes%% and I like the pun later suggested by furnace. ~M] his own eyes would seem to carry the risk of blindness, of being consumed in a cosmic furnace (perhaps of love) to a crisp.

That's why the planets do that. And, of course, many simply don't care at all.

And ever since that day(s), it had been, once again, in her nature to care.

Which natural capacity had been exhausted from her, with regard to the outer world, about a year and a half into her marriage (although irrelevant from it), in another incident of crucial importance to understanding her life history and other such trivialities:

On this particular occasion, she had found a baby fallen in the mud, and took it home and cleaned it up, and raised, for a time, this beautiful baby boy as her own son. But, eventually some people showed up and claimed the child as their own. On rather shaky evidence — and this is what had always bothered her since — she surrendered the ankelbiter to the strangers. They before too long put him up to a career in show business and he became an international famous child star, starring alongside various primates in various novelty films mostly about how cute it is that children and monkeys act funny. But none of that mattered to her in particular. The turn of events had convinced her of the haphazard nature of fate and she had never quite recovered from that. Never, that is, until meeting Term[$ yeah, in his culture the familiar address is the last name, whatever]. What is the necessary connexion[@ This turn of phrase and spelling is a David Hume reference. ~M] between these two psychic events[@ a psychic event just means something that happens in your mind, in this case shifts in attitude.

Is this the APT package manager from Debian/Ubuntu?"; but the actual meaning is that the child was removed, at a remove from, (which we can clarify with an è instead of an e, which only really influences the pronunciation but the new suggested pronunciation is more suggestive of the actual meaning) her self (thus "auto") (since we're considering it, basically, from her point of view) (a more natural reading is that the child removed itself or is removed from itself, but I don't mean that). ~M] success of her erstwhile wildchild had sad?

Maybe he was the only human she had ever known. Reginald, the dear, seemed to be pure psyche at times. (And this, he said, was how he would assure himself a long life, by various cheats and swindles of various enemies, up to and including God and Death.) And she had that in common with dear Reginald. Whereëver it was he was now ———— wouldn't you like to know! But there was one thing they didn't have in common, in this circumstance:
