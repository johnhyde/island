Francesca ***Metcalf*** Digsxby was so tired. The botched botched betrayal and it’s[sic][@ This "it’s[sic]" joke used to live in the prologue, as "before it’s[sic] time", where it was pretty clearly a reference to the previous dialogue “‘took it’s own course,’ with an apostrophe!”, until John moved it here. I just think that's interesting. ~M] consequences[@ This is a subtle reference to _Industrial Society And Its Future_~M] had been a disaster for her personally. She felt an overwhelming burden of guilt over her husband’s mysterious disappearance.[^attorney] She couldn’t really blame herself, if she was being fair. She’d done what she thought was right, and she’d arranged everything with excellence and even panache, but one spot of bad luck (or was it poor judgment?) had spoiled everything in an instant.

[^attorney]: her attorneys have advised me to maintain a certain ambiguity about why exactly this is.

Essentially, her Pookie was not supposed to have disappeared. He wasn’t even supposed to have fallen unconscious at the moment of betrayal. It would seem that Francesca had seriously underestimated the delicacy of his nerves, and for this she might never forgive herself, although even now it was hard to believe. But he _had_ fallen unconscious, and when he’d awoken he’d shocked both her and Manuel (if indeed that machine can be shocked) by launching immediately into a violent flailing, by which we must assume he hoped to attain freedom from what we must assume he assumed to be his captivity. As fate would have it, in one of his blind strikes he impaled his one hand on one of Manuel’s utility spikes.

Well, I won’t bore you with the details, but basically things got out of hand very quickly from there. In particular, a good amount of Reginald’s blood got out of his hand very quickly. But also in a general sense. It became clear that certain things[^things] would need to be done to recover any semblance of control over the situation, which things were done, which Francesca found, ultimately, very tiring.

[^things]: those pesky attorneys, I tell ya

So she was relieved when she finally found herself with a moment to let her hair down and not do anything specific for an hour.

After 15 minutes listlessly[@ lol ~J] humming to herself, throwing that around the room and rooms as always, she decided to take an inventory of the house, the flying island. She started by listing[@ not so listless anymore! ~J] to herself all of the boats that were in the house, which were named after the boats in the Iliad. Once she was done with this, she decided to take an inventory of every room of the house. There was the galley, of course. And then the galley of a different sense. And then the gallery. And so on. She passed into the morning room. Pray it would never become a mourning room — or perhaps it would... And then, of course, was the secret dungeon, in which Mr Digsxby was being kept. What was left of him,[$How much of him is left? Maybe it's all of him. Wouldn't you like to know!] so to speak. But it was not good to think of it now. It would simply lead her to distraction in this, her moment of solace and solitude, and she'd thought about it enough in the past, oh, indeterminate hours.

The hulking inanimate carapace of Manuel the big robot hulked over her. Hulk, hulk.

"Will you be needing anything, Madam?" asked Manuel, in his distinctive yet non-unpleasant robotic-toned roboty voice.

Francesca, who was sometimes called Fran to her friends or Franny to her family or 'Cesca to her lover or sometimes for apparently no reason at all Eleanor, didn't open her eyes. "There's no need to do that voice. We're alone."

"Of course, madam," said Manuel, in a distinctively non-distinctive voice.

"Oh, come off it!" said Fran, weakly throwing a small pillow at the overgrown tin can. With a *bzt, bzhrt, zhuu* noise that seemed to be produced by a human mouth, the front of the robot-suit's face-visor opened, revealing the handsomely mustached human visage of the ultimately enfleshèd Manuel Ordinator Computer Gonzalez.

He sat down beside her on the sofa on which she’d collapsed, awkwardly because of his carapace, and attempted to tenderly pick a stray confetto from her hair with his lever-operated robot-pincers. To distract her from the difficulty he was having with this, he said, “You know, it could be worse. All in all, it could have gone much worse.”

She sighed a deep, somewhat performative sigh. “How?”

Manuel was alternately gripping the confetto with different pairs of pincers, hoping he could stop alternately gripping her hair at some point. “Well,” he said, “the fireworks could have malfunctioned and exploded at street-level, injuring innocents, or spelled the wrong message.”

“The thing itself went about as badly as it could, though.” Franny was in a mood to argue. “The fireworks were just a bit of flair.”[$ and a lot of flare] Then she let out a squeak as Manuel finally removed the confetto, yanking a few last hairs in the process. She opened her eyes to glare at him and saw that he was working hard not to glare at her. Instead he glared at the coffee table, or perhaps at the little marble elephant thereon. Manuel wanted to say, _I put a great deal of effort into those fireworks_, but he kept his mouth shut. He heard a cute little voice coming (seemingly) from the elephant on the coffee table, saying, “What’s the matter Mr. Robot Man? Are you mad at me?”

“My apologies, Little Elephant Boy,” Manuel said in a somewhat robotic tone, “I was just calculating how much time and money I spent on a fireworks display that the user has now deemed to be unnecessary trash garbage.”

Francesca felt simultaneously the urge to apologize and comfort him and the urge to slap him upside his stupid metal head. Was he really going to be sensitive about his fireworks display right now? Her entire life was crashing down around her, and now she also had to be sensitive to his feelings? But also, she _was_ sensitive to his feelings; it was her nature to be so.
