We will take a brief flashforward now, to the year 3042 — they having dispensed with all this hexadecimal year business [$ a good lark and a good try, they all thought, and great future-proofing in keeping the epoch[$ which epoch is ever, putatively, the supposèd birth of the christchild — the only undisputed date in history[$[disputed]]] the same, but, much like my eventual conclusion when I tried to adapt to reading a 24-hour clock, at some point one must accept the familiar convention as superior due to familiarity alone. And so they went back to the ten-finger-alicious system beloved by those imperfect automata (man).]in the the future future[$ the future future being the future of the future, of course] — in which Lars Squiggle — those of you taking bets at home as to who would survive the novel may make some sort of mark on your scorecards, perhaps, but not too hastily, for who knows what facts may later be divulged? Only my lawyers [$(and they have legal privilege of uttermost secrecy; and, furthermore, do not actually exist.)] — who, due to a series of Homestuckean shenanigans, currently looked about ten years younger than when this narrative last saw him, due to his soul occupying a robot body replica of himself these days — see what I mean? — sat. He was playing poker. Strip poker.

“Poker? I ’ardly know ’er,” burbled his companion, Robo-Thomas, for about the 15th time that week. Lars didn't justify this remark with a reply. He was too busy looking at his cards. He couldn't remember if aces were still high in the future future. That had always seemed like a weird rule to him; maybe it was one of those things they had re-abolished. Then again, the game was only 5-card draw, so not very interesting, so he avoided asking the rules, to keep things more interesting for himself. It’d been weeks since he had lost a game.

They were sitting in a space cantina, with jozz[^1]blasting on the speakers behind them. Damn place was too much of a cheap dive to afford a live band, or even a proper playlist on Intergalactic Spotify. Ads came on every 15 space minutes to remind them that, on some planets, goods and services could be purchased. Still, said space canteen was the closest contact point between humankind and any other alien species, and Lars Squiggle — all other terrestrial problems having been solved, as it was the future future — was an intrepid space explorer and xenobiologist. And so he was here, boozing up a gin hound or vice versa or whatever, playing strip poker with alien species he was not at all attracted to, in order to learn their feisty biological secrets — hopefully before they learned his![@ this concept was developed by J extemporaneously as I played a strip poker flash game(?) I found online]

So far this was his easiest opponent yet.[@ novels like to ramp up the tension by cutting you to the most exciting and difficult moments. Not me! Ahahaha get rekt.] These spaces creatures, the *Anymé*[@ I'm self-plagarizing this concept from a tabletop rpg campaign I once ran, in which I made a setting detail an equivalent joke], looked remarkably humanoid, although he had already ascertained that they had no DNA to speak of and instead were entirely composed of ghosts. Ghosts of what, he couldn't say. They also had enormous eyes.

The females of the species tended to have enormous breasts, and the male tended to have huge hands. Both sexes were completely ass at playing poker. It's like they didn't even know the rules. They couldn't tell a rank from a suit![@ I admit that this is a subtle joke about hanafuda cards, which have 4 ranks and 13 suits; I'm almost ashamed to have made such a pointless joke. [@ it's not even funny to me and I know the reference] Oh well!] “Itadakimasu,” said one of the aliens, as the round was beginning. Their language was incomprehensible and no one had been able to explain the rules to them. Nevertheless, they denuded themselves with admirable grace and honor — and Lars examined their denuded honorables & reproductive acts with graceful admiration. You never really could be sure why any given alien species wears clothes in the first place. Many of them walked about completely nude except for their protective, heavy space suits. However, Lars was beginning to suspect that the Anymé were homologous to humans in more ways than one. They also never stopped talking.

Lars played his hand and was pleased to discover it was still a royal flush. The Anymé warrioress across from him had played high card 5 of spades. Again, just a dismal grasp of the game. He cracked a smile and adjusted his tie, like in his favorite song (“Oxford Comma” by Vampire Weekend — a golden oldie) as the Anymistréss disrobed rather unseductively. “This reminds me of that time you lied about how much coal you had,” he said to Robo-Thomas. “AFFIRMATIVE” said Thomas (robo slang for “yeah”). “You remember that?” asked Lars, wistfully. “NEGATORY” said Thomas (a made-up word meaning “no” that science-minded types like using for some reason) “No?” asked Lars, somewhat rhetorically. “It was during The Year Of The Great Burning. During the — the martini killer escapade, I think you called him? The United Nations was involved too, if I recall correctly.” “OH, YEAH.” said Thomas, still doing the robot voice. Lars continued: “The one where we killed Lord Fitzthistlewits.”

It was Christmas. Space Christmas. This is a Christmas special. Chapter. MERRY CHRISTMAS! 🎅
