Islands, today, have bewitching ways about them. Hovering islands now, that's what Reginald Digsx^[1]by likes. Big is best, and huge, frothing, municipal islands wear the cloaks of grandiosity like a newly weft^[2] puppet wears a gossamer veil of impudence. He counts upon his left-hand hand because his right-hand one was lost in The Great War of Succession and Mirth, in Barcelona (his home away from home) — fifteen fingers on the first blast and the rest on the second. He needed to count high—very high—so much so that he had to acquire huge-ass finger-islands for his island-hands^[3]. Nevertheless, he felt a shrewd, creeping, fellow travell[^4]er would soon betray his trust; it was only appropriate, he supposed. That would be the way his story reached its lugubrious end—or would it?!  The deciding factor lay in the calculus of the froth. People respect a good man of one brutally honest calculus. Thus: his forthright^[5] manner of business in the tallying of the froth-people was essential. Mrs. Digsx^[1]by counts double. His wife was, in general, a largely assiduous help-meet, but sadly she was too frothy to be just a single unit. Islands of all sorts must reside within the bosom of such women, as did the basest continents incontinent.
