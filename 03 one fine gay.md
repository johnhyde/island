In his 1907 bartenders' guide _The World's Drinks And How To Mix Them_, San Francisco mixologist William Boothby provided possibly the earliest recipe for a "Dry Martini Cocktail" not only resembling a modern-day martini in the ingredients, but also under that name.[^[14]]

His mind raced. His mind started figuratively playing Mario Kart,[^kart] attempting to sift through an avalanche of theories that fell toward his mind as he groped about in different directions. Maybe this was the work of The Martini Killer, a hot new serial killer making a striking double-debut. Mayhaps the very concept of a Martini was becoming more fatal, lashing out. Peradventure one of these deaths was inspired by the other... Mai’s body had seemed fresh, so it was possible her killer had heard of the schmuck getting struck and figured that was as good a murder theme as any. But perchance [@ You can't just say perchance[$ this is an in-joke reference to Phil Jamesson's Mario "paper"] ~M] there was a closer connection, or none at all! Could be that some group was carrying out coordinated attacks with Martini glasses as their calling card, their identifying item, their typical tip-off, their—

His mind’s Mario and his kart stopped in their tracks. He’d been wasting time thinking about the case when he should have been rambling about with no apparent purpose, doing whatever felt right! He anxiously turned his attention back to the Track, trying to focus in that fuzzy way on the general vibe rather than anything specific. It took a very particular frame of mind to stay On Track, but Thomas was experienced. After a moment, he smiled. A Delta.

Every now and then, the Track would split off in a million different directions, each path about equally valid, before reconstricting to a singular course. He thought of it like a river delta, branching off and diffusing. He thought of floating lazily down the Mississippi, or enjoying a moment of weightlessness during a ski jump. He could, it would ==seem==[@ needs a comma here?] ponder the case at his leisure for a time, or go finish his lunch, or go for a hike, or take a nap, or any number of things. At some point, of course—and he’d have to be paying attention—he’d feel the draw and acceleration back towards the main current. But for now, he could make his own way.

Thomas was so used to following his intuition in strange, unpredictable directions, that when he came to a Delta while On the Job, he liked to play around at doing real detective work. So he decided to finish his lunch, which he could see a waitress was about to clear away, find another establishment where they served alcohol, and order a ==Martini.==[@martini is not a proper noun(?) so it shouldn't be capitalized(?)]

“Excuse me, miss,” Thomas exclaimed amiably, “I’d like to finish that after all. I just had to step away for a moment.” The girl looked at him in shock. Thomas wondered at that.

“I’m sorry, mister, but I’ve already cleared your plate from the table. I’m now[@ previously typoed “not” which totally messed up the meaning, reeeeeee] carrying it to the back where the food will be thrown in the trash and Jerry will put it in the dishwasher.” She spoke with such conviction that Thomas didn’t know how to argue with her.

Thomas moved his hands slowly, maintaining eye contact with her, trying to match her intensity well enough to distract her as he grabbed his plate with both hands and began to pull it towards himself. Her grip was tight, and she took a forced step toward him to avoid relinquishing her grip or extending her arm. Thomas brought the plate to his sternum, as caught up in her gaze as he’d hoped she’d be in his.

Their faces were now a bit too close. She smelled nice. Her stern face was well-featured. Her energy was captivating. She whispered, “If you eat your food now, before I take it back, that would be all right.”

Hesitantly, as though afraid of being tricked, Thomas let go of the plate with his right hand and took a morsel of omelette in his fingers. The girl jerked the plate back as he chewed, but he held on tightly. It seemed to have been an involuntary spasm born of an instinct which she was actively resisting. She was holding a short stack of other plates in her other hand, and she seemed to take comfort in retaining control of _them_, at least.

Thomas continued to eat, looking into her eyes. He thought he saw a micromovement, a briefest flick of the eyes down at the bacon or the potatoes, so he lifted a strip of bacon, and extended it towards her mouth. She blushed and took on an even sterner and more shocked aspect, but her lips also twitched. And then she did, she opened her mouth to take a bite of bacon.

It was around this time that Thomas became aware of at least one additional pair of eyes holding him in attentive regard.

The items sort of fall of the shelves when you swipe at them, so it’s as much about dodging expensive, unnecessary items as it is about getting what you came for.

"Excuse me," Thomas excused himself.
