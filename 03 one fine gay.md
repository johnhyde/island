In his 1907 bartenders' guide _The World's Drinks And How To Mix Them_, San Francisco mixologist William Boothby provided possibly the earliest recipe for a "Dry Martini Cocktail" not only resembling a modern-day martini in the ingredients, but also under that name.[^14]

His mind raced. His mind started figuratively playing Mario Kart,[^kart] attempting to sift through an avalanche of theories that fell toward his mind as he groped about in different directions. Maybe this was the work of The Martini Killer, a hot new serial killer making a striking double-debut. Mayhaps the very concept of a Martini was becoming more fatal, lashing out. Peradventure one of these deaths was inspired by the other... Mai’s body had seemed fresh, so it was possible her killer had heard of the schmuck getting struck and figured that was as good a murder theme as any. But perchance[@ I can just say perchance if you can! ~J] there was a closer connection, or none at all! Could be that some group was carrying out coordinated attacks with martini glasses as their calling card, their identifying item, their typical tip-off, their—

His mind’s Mario and his kart stopped in their tracks. He’d been wasting time thinking about the case when he should have been rambling about with no apparent purpose, doing whatever felt right! He anxiously turned his attention back to the Track, trying to focus in that fuzzy way on the general vibe rather than anything specific. It took a very particular frame of mind to stay On Track, but Thomas was experienced. After a moment, he smiled. A Delta.

Every now and then, the Track would split off in a million different directions, each path about equally valid, before reconstricting to a singular course. He thought of it like a river delta, branching off and diffusing. He thought of floating lazily down the Mississippi, or enjoying a moment of weightlessness during a ski jump. He could, it would seem, ponder the case at his leisure for a time, or go finish his lunch, or go for a hike, or take a nap, or any number of things. At some point, of course—and he’d have to be paying attention—he’d feel the draw and acceleration back towards the main current. But for now, he could make his own way.

Thomas was so used to following his intuition in strange, unpredictable directions, that when he came to a Delta while On the Job, he liked to play around at doing real detective work. So he decided to finish his lunch, which he could see a waitress was about to clear away, find another establishment where they served alcohol, and order a martini.

“Excuse me, miss,” Thomas exclaimed amiably, “I’d like to finish that after all. I just had to step away for a moment.” The girl looked at him in shock. Thomas wondered at that.

“I’m sorry, mister, but I’ve already cleared your plate from the table. I’m now carrying it to the back where the food will be thrown in the trash and Jerry will put it in the dishwasher.” She spoke with such conviction that Thomas didn’t know how to argue with her.

Thomas moved his hands slowly, maintaining eye contact with her, trying to match her intensity well enough to distract her as he grabbed his plate with both hands and began to pull it towards himself. Her grip was tight, and she took a forced step toward him to avoid relinquishing her grip or extending her arm. Thomas brought the plate to his sternum, as caught up in her gaze as he’d hoped she’d be in his.

Their faces were now a bit too close. She smelled nice. Her stern face was well-featured. Her energy was captivating. She whispered, “If you eat your food now, before I take it back, that would be all right.”

Hesitantly, as though afraid of being tricked, Thomas let go of the plate with his right hand and took a morsel of omelette in his fingers. The girl jerked the plate back as he chewed, but he held on tightly. It seemed to have been an involuntary spasm born of an instinct which she was actively resisting. She was holding a short stack of other plates in her other hand, and she seemed to take comfort in retaining control of _them_, at least.

Thomas continued to eat, looking into her eyes. He thought he saw a micromovement, a briefest flick of the eyes down at the bacon or the potatoes, so he lifted a strip of bacon, and extended it towards her mouth. She blushed and took on an even sterner and more shocked aspect, but her lips also twitched. And then she did, she opened her mouth to take a bite of bacon.

It was around this time that Thomas became aware of at least one additional pair of eyes holding him in attentive regard.

[^kart]: Flying Island Plumbing Company released, as a marketing scheme, a free mobile game in which you play as Mario, the human man, running around a hardware store trying to acquire the necessary plumbing equipment and tools for a home repair job. The items sort of fall of the shelves when you swipe at them, so it’s as much about dodging expensive, unnecessary items as it is about getting what you came for.

"Excuse me," Thomas excused himself. He quickly walked over to the stranger who had been sitting at a counter and watching the little escapade. Said stranger was — and this was what most grabbed Thomas's attention — drinking a martini. Thomas hadn't even realized you could get a martini at this joint.

"Who the hell are you?" Thomas decided to start.

"Paul Eeny, gumshoe," said Paul Eeny.[$ gumshoe is in the vocative; it's not part of Paul Eeny's name] "And I have a couple of questions for you."

Thomas remembered, too late, that he liked to have the upper hand by guessing people's names. "Ah, um," he fished around in his intuitions for anything he could one-up this man, who had just said his own name, with. "Martin Eeny's gay lover?"

Paul nodded. "The very same."[^chaste]

[^chaste]: Digressively, it must be said that "gay lover" on the islands means something akin to "euphoric aficionado". Paul Eeny (who was, orthogonally, a homosexual), had devoted his life to Martin Eeny in a chaste and loyal fashion, just because he thought he was an excellent man. He also had taken his last name. Their friendship was rich and beautiful. To see it would bring a tear of joy to your eye. Paul Eeny had never had sex, and never would; as was the style at the time.

Thomas hadn't a clue who Martin Eeny was, but this seemed like a good start. In fact, now that he was thinking about it, that name sounded kind of fake. Well, whatever. He'd probably figure all that out later. "Shoot," he growled, indicating that Paul should ask those aforementioned questions. Fair was fair. A question for a question.

Paul Eeny stood up, suddenly, the ball in his court now. "Where were you the night of the fifth?!"

"Uh," began Thomas.

"What do you know about Reginald Metcalf Digsxby?!"

"Hold on—" said Thomas.

"Who's buried in Grant's Tomb?!"

"Hold on!" said Thomas.

"How did you know I knew Martin when I've never seen you before in my life?!"

"Hold on!" bellowed Thomas. "**I'll** be asking the questions here!"

"What color was Washington's white horse?!"

"White!" declared Thomas. "Ha! My turn. How did you know I was a detective?!"

"Well, hold—"

"Why have you been watching me in this cafe?!"

"Hold on—"

"Where the hell did you get that martini?!"

"Hold on just a minute—"

"Do you think that waitress likes me or was she just hungry?!"

"That's not really—"

"What does Mai Friend have to do with the Martini Killer — if that *is* his real name?!" Thomas pounded the table.

"Your next question will be: how do you know about the Track?"

Thomas was flabbergasted. "*How do you know about the Track?!*"

"Ha!"

[J; 560 words]

Thomas braced himself for the next volley of interrogation, but instead he just saw Paul E. looking at him tenderly. Tears seemed to be welling in his eyes, but it was hard to tell because tears were also welling in Thomas’ eyes. Thomas thought to himself that he’d better stop getting so darn intimate with everyone he met or else he’d lose his edge.

Paul Metcalf Eeny eventually regained control of his voice and said, “Do you remember the Christmas of 0x8ed[^hex], when the whole clan gathered at Uncle Fresno’s ranch and it snowed so much that tunnels had to be dug, and most people left that way but some decided to stay until they could excavate their cars, and their children had a grand time digging superfluous tunnels and imagining life as a mole or a refugee from nuclear devastation, and though it was only a few days, those days felt like a whole winter, a most magical post-Christmas which ran just up to the New Year, the eve of which was marked by Northern Lights and fireworks and an unaccountable, almost mystical, experience of revelation and orientation, after which your life was never the same again?!”

[^hex]: Paul, like most, pronounces it, “oh ex eight ee dee,” although some cheeky youth have taken to saying things like, “ox eight ed”[$ some have even adopted such infelicities as pronouncing it "ox bed", *even though b is also a valid year digit*. Madness! ~M]

“Yes.” said Thomas.

“So do I.” said Paul.

“I didn’t recognize you,” said Thomas through the nausea, “It’s been a while.”

“Neither did I, and yes it has.”

“So... you too? I thought I was the only one.”

“I thought _I_ was the only one. But today the Track has led me to you, and vice versa. But actually I call it the Groove when I’m not trying to shock and awe my long-lost cousins.” Paul took a sip of his martini and smirked internally. He was so In the Groove right now, he could almost forget his grief.

Thomas’ gears were turning. He was still in the Delta, that was good. Yes, he remembered Paul now. He’d been of the continental side of the family, which Thomas had only really met on that one occasion because his parents didn’t like to leave the islands. He didn’t have any particularly strong impression of Paul from that time, just that he’d been a few years younger and they’d played together with Rachel and Arbo and Gleeson, and... had Franny been there? Yes, Franny had left before New Year’s though. She’d had a racquetball tournament to get to or something...

But then Thomas thought, and said, “But what does it matter where I was on the night of the fifth?”

“What does any of it matter?” said Paul, having finished his martini, but not having forgotten his grief (and ordering another martini).

Thomas held up two fingers to the barman to indicate he’d like one as well. He sat down next to his cousin and put a hand on his shoulder. He said, as gently as he could, “I’m going to be real with you: I don’t know what you’re on about and while I’ll probably figure it out eventually, maybe you’d like to just tell me?”

Paul sighed dramatically and watched the barman shaking and stirring the drinks.[$ this is what they do on the islands; it’s their culture] Martin wouldn’t have indulged in this sort of day-drinking, but what good had his prudence done him??

Prudence, which was the name of that waitress, there it was,[@?] massaged the back of Thomas while the two intuitive investigators talked.

"They have yet to invent a problem that can't be solved by day drinking, it's crazy," mused Paul Eeny. He didn't really sound like he believed it.

Thomas took his hand off Paul's shoulder and tapped the tips of his fingers together. This approach was getting him nowhere — fast! On the other hand, maybe it would get him somewhere slow, which was also fine. This was detective work at its peak. He was pumping a source for information. Meanwhile, Prudence was massaging a source, the source of his stress, the tension he carried in his shoulders — or so they say. His eyes drifted to the sign by the bar and he realized, to his delight, that not only was the bar in the cafe open, (BAR: 1PM–2AM) but it was also Happy Hour (HAPPY HOUR: 1PM–6PM). That's the happiest hour of all. And it also takes up 5 consecutive hours, so you know it's good. As Thomas considered grabbing Paul by the lapels and shaking him and yelling "WHAT HAPPENED ON THE FIFTH?!", Prudence grabbed him by the lapels, in an altogether nonthreatening and entirely different way, and started working on whatever muscle group it is that is below the lapels, getting the muscle knots out of that, whatever those are.[@ lmaooooo]

Thomas' eyes lit upon the portion of the sign that said "Happy Beginning: $5". "I... I'd like a Happy Beginning,"[@ one wonders what exactly he expected this to get him] he announced loudly to the bar as a whole, as Prudence's hands now addressed the problems of his lower trapezius.

"Oh, certainly sir!" said the barman, surprised. He got a small, ordinary glass from the shelve[$shelf], put it next to the second martini glass,[@ but what about the third?] and then poured coffee liqueur [$it's traditional to say "Kahlúa" here, but we are not slaves to the Kahlúa corporation [$no slaves to the Free and Sovereign State of Veracruz de Ignacio de la Llave, we!]] and lactose-free milk into it. He handed it to Thomas, who promptly drank it.

Smacking his lips, Thomas asked, "why do they call it a Happy Beginning?".

Prudence was massaging his biceps.

"Well, it has coffee, and also milk that won't make you sick or bloated, and also alcohol, and a sort of tropical feeling. So, it's a good way to start your morning."

"Well, I thought they named drinks like racehorses."

"How do you mean, sir?"

"Ah, like, this drink is like a White Russian but without the vodka. So maybe they could call it a White... Russianless. A White Russophile.[@ or Russophobe?] White <span lang="es-MX">sin</span> Rus. Something of this nature."

"I see." The bartender was clearly impressed.

"I thought a Happy Beginning was a recursive coffee liqueur," said Paul.

"Oh, like a coffee with a coffee liqueur in it?" asked the bartender. "We have one of those here but we call it a coffee liqueur coffee."

"I think it's more fractal than that," said Paul.

"Well, whatever it is," said Thomas, "this may be the happy beginning of a beautiful friendship!" Prudence was massaging his spleen now.

"I find cream makes a sort of fractal shape when you pour it into coffee, or vice versa," commented the barman.

"Say," said Thomas, the first licks of alcohol starting to kick, "what kind of place is this, that is a cafe, and also a bar, and also a massage parlor?"

"Well, sir, it's the Metropolitan Cafe."

"The... *what?*" Paul and Thomas both said at once, although neither could say exactly why.

"The Metropolitan Cafe," the bartender repeated, pointing his arm straight out to his left. Both men followed his gesture with their eyes and saw, in big block letters, on the wall, the sign of the establishment, which read:

METropolitan
CAFe

Paul and Thomas gaped at the sign, and then looked at each other, and then back to the sign, and then back to each other. "BRooooo," they both said.

[@ Metropolian Cafe, or met-cafe....]
