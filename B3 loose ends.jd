## Questions Raised by Specific Scenes

### The Secret Tunnel
- **How did Bus find the secret tunnel?** Just luck?
- **Where does it lead?** Connected to other places in the city?
- **Who built it?** Martinius? Someone else?
- **Why does it open from inside Martinius's apartment?**

### The Zoo Incident

- **Why was "Marvinlust" disguised as a cowboy?**
- **Did Florida Mann recognize anything suspicious?**
- **The lasso** - where did it end up? Who cares?

### The Aeroömnibus

- **Did he know the Beach Detective would be on that bus?**
- **The pills he offered** - what were they? Related to the poison?
- **"Don't eat cheeses around me-ses"** - MAOI reference (medication that interacts with cheese); is he actually offering MAOIs?

### The Metropolitan Cafe
- **Why is it called MET-CAFE?** Emphasized in the story
- **Did the poisoning happen here?**

## Thematic Questions

### Fate vs. Free Will
- **What would happen if Thomas resisted the track?**
- **Is following the Track morally good?** It has "cruel and mechanical indifference"
- **Does the Track serve justice?** Or just completion of events?
- **Why does God grant some people the Track?** Thomas and Paul, but not others

### Betrayal
- **Was Francesca's betrayal justified?** We don't know her full motivation
- **Would someone else have betrayed Reginald?** His paranoia suggested multiple possibilities
- **Is Manuel betraying someone?** Loyal to Francesca over Reginald?
- **The botched betrayal** - was any part intentional? The "one spot of bad luck (or poor judgment)"

### Justice & Murder
- **Is Martinius just a serial killer?** Or does he have a cause?
- **Are the detective murders about stopping the investigation?** Or part of the plan?
- **Georgia's accusations against Francesca** - is she right?
- **Lars Squiggle's assignment** - is it about justice? Revenge? Politics?

## Meta Questions

### Narrative Structure
- **Who is the protagonist?** Thomas? The Beach Detective? Ensemble cast?
- **What is the central mystery?** The murders? The Digsxby disappearance? The Metcalf connection?
- **How do the parallel timelines converge?** Beach Detective, Thomas, Georgia Mann all investigating
- **When will characters meet?** Thomas/Beach Detective? Beach Detective/Georgia? Paul/anyone?

## Potential Red Herrings

Things that might be misdirection:
- The Metcalf name connection (might be coincidence)
- Dr. Michaelmas Term being alive (might actually be dead)
- The baby Francesca gave up (might be irrelevant character detail)
- The builder being "taken care of" (might just mean bribed to secrecy)
- Georg Smelv and Archbishop Winterpipe (might be unrelated to main plot)

## Things That Definitely Need Resolution

These are the minimum plot threads that MUST be resolved:
1. What happened to Reginald - escape? death? rescue?
2. Martinius's master plan and motive
3. Thomas's fate - will he escape? defeat Martinius?
4. Paul and Prudence's safety
5. The Metcalf name connection
6. What's in the MART.INI file
7. Beach Detective's mission conclusion
8. Georgia Mann's investigation outcome
9. What's in Francesca's box
10. Is Dr. Michaelmas Term actually dead?
