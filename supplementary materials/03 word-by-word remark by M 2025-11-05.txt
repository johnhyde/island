(context: during the composition, C wanted to turn the "had" M had chosen (on the first line of prose) into "hadn't". There were no firm rules for this at that point¹, so M said "yes, if you separate them with a hyphen".)

¹: later they stopped writing spaces after their words to purposefully allow for more of this tomfoolery

Honestly I should have written that hyphen so that I would show up in my color, since I was just giving orders. Oh well!
