Appendix: EXTRACTS

[@ This is mostly just a weird project of M; no one else needs worry about it. (But nor is it forbidden to also contribute either in substance or in structure ideas.) ~M]

[@ Instead of actually using epigraphs (more than we already do), perhaps make a "chapter" of Extracts, like in moby dick ... perhaps in our extracts, posit a connexion to specific points in the story for each one, like epigraphs, yes, but which don't disrupt the pace of the actual novel. ~M]

It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of a poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long Vaticans and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random allusions to whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever, sacred or profane. Therefore you must not, in every case at least, take the higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in these extracts, for veritable gospel cetology. Far from it. As touching the ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here appearing, these extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as affording a glancing bird’s eye view of what has been promiscuously said, thought, fancied, and sung of Leviathan, by many nations and generations, including our own.

The Cool Lawyer, who swears in court. Clients are impressed with the bold rebelliousness, the devil-may-care attitude. Judges do not put up with it, it is tremendously to The Cool Lawyer's detriment, they lose every case, etc.

The pride I feel for finally fingering my father's killer is dampened only by the fact that I promised to kill my father's killer. I fingered myself. To death.
