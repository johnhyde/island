Appendix: EXTRACTS

Instead of using epigraphs (more than we already feel the call to do), here is a "chapter" of Extracts, like in moby dick ... in our extracts, sometimes we posit a connexion (◆ or spelled out as "corresponds") to specific points in the book for each one, like epigraphs, yes, but which don't disrupt the pace of the actual novel. ~M

This is mostly just a weird project of M; no one else needs worry about it. (But nor is it forbidden to also contribute either in substance or in structure ideas.) ~M

There are many things here which are, at least for the moment, half-hearted formatted or sourced. "Idk" means I don't know. (I could theoretically find out; if I try and give up I'll just go with "Unknown" for the source. Also if I find no correspondence I'll take the quote out and use it as an epitaph in a different project, probably.)

It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of a poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long Vaticans and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random allusions to whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever, sacred or profane. Therefore you must not, in every case at least, take the higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in these extracts, for veritable gospel cetology. Far from it. As touching the ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here appearing, these extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as affording a glancing bird’s eye view of what has been promiscuously said, thought, fancied, and sung of Leviathan, by many nations and generations, including our own.

SUMUS MODO VIRI MEDIOCRES

— HACARIUS I. CANIS, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF7_tlg6hHk [@ I. is short for Ille, a word which in late latin took up the function of "the", which Hacker's middle name is. cf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie_ille_Pu. Hacarius is a latinization of Hacker's given name, which I do not believe to be necessary when translating — but I find it amusing to do this, in the long historical vein of europeans in random countries also doing this when writing in Latin. Hacarius is sort of a half-effort. It's no "Hans"→"Ioannes" via unimpeachable etymology, instead just a latinization based on sound. I attempted to chase Hacker (which is, indeed, apparently, he who hacks, a woodcutter) up the Proto-Indo-European tree and back down but hit a dead end not knowing whither the root went in Latin, if anywhere. (I'm not sure if that's how they did it back in the day, anyway.) Anyway, the translation of the utterance is from the video, but no translation of Hacker's name is given there. The utterance means "we're just ordinary men".~M]
