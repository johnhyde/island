Appendix: EXTRACTS

[@ This is mostly just a weird project of M; no one else needs worry about it. (But nor is it forbidden to also contribute either in substance or in structure ideas.) ~M]

[@ Instead of actually using epigraphs (more than we already do), perhaps make a "chapter" of Extracts, like in moby dick ... perhaps in our extracts, posit a connexion to specific points in the story for each one, like epigraphs, yes, but which don't disrupt the pace of the actual novel. ~M]

It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of a poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long Vaticans and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random allusions to whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever, sacred or profane. Therefore you must not, in every case at least, take the higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in these extracts, for veritable gospel cetology. Far from it. As touching the ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here appearing, these extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as affording a glancing bird’s eye view of what has been promiscuously said, thought, fancied, and sung of Leviathan, by many nations and generations, including our own.

The Cool Lawyer, who swears in court. Clients are impressed with the bold rebelliousness, the devil-may-care attitude. Judges do not put up with it, it is tremendously to The Cool Lawyer's detriment, they lose every case, etc.

The pride I feel for finally fingering my father's killer is dampened only by the fact that I promised to kill my father's killer. I fingered myself. To death.

SUMUS MODO VIRI MEDIOCRES

— HACARIUS I. CANIS, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF7_tlg6hHk [@ I. is short for Ille, a word which in late latin took up the function of "the", which Hacker's middle name is. cf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie_ille_Pu. Hacarius is a latinization of Hacker's given name, which I do not believe to be necessary when translating — but I find it amusing to do this, in the long historical vein of europeans in random countries also doing this when writing in Latin. Hacarius is sort of a half-effort. It's no "Hans"→"Ioannes" via unimpeachable etymology, instead just a latinization based on sound. I attempted to chase Hacker (which is, indeed, apparently, he who hacks, a woodcutter) up the Proto-Indo-European tree and back down but hit a dead end not knowing whither the root went in Latin, if anywhere. (I'm not sure if that's how they did it back in the day, anyway.) Anyway, the translation of the utterance is from the video, but no translation of Hacker's name is given there. The utterance means "we're just ordinary men".~M]
