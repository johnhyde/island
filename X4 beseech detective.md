"I think I can explain," said the beach detective.

"Yes, please do!" everyone cried out in unison.

"On the night of the 31st of December, Reginald was worried about betrayal, as usual. His wife and man(?)servant decided to play on this, and pretend to betray him just to surprise him with a new year's fireworks display. Franny was betraying him just so he could get being betrayed out of his system and move on. A very weak betrayal. However, in the confusion and following confusion, Reginald injured his hand and also his head. He was put into the secret dungeon to rest and recuperate. Meanwhile, his wife reported him missing, as otherwise his enemies would surely take advantage of his handless state to assassinate him during his many public appearances he would otherwise have to make." [@ I can change this if it doesn't match the plot later]

[@ The beach detective has been dispatched by one such enemy, or perhaps another heir apparent, to see if he's really missing. The mysterious stranger on the bus will also come visit Reginald in the dungeon, for no reason.%%]

"But what about the Martini Killer?" asked Thomas.

"Who?" asked the beach detective.

"Asking about me?!" said a figure in the open doorway.

Everybody's heads snapped to look at him. "The Martini Killer!!"

"Just so," said the lounge-besuitted man who was now briskly walking towards everyone. "And I'm about to make all of you... Martini Killed!"

"That isn't good." X

"That isn't a very one at all. What about Martini... Chilled!" Y

"Maybe... Ver-moot?" Z

"That could work in this context, I guess," Y

"No, I mean it isn't good that he's about to kill us." X

"Oh yeah. That too." Y

"But wait! Don't you want to explain what you have to do with Reginald Digsxby?" W

"I thought you'd never ask!" said the martini killer, excitedly. He began:

"You see, Reginald Digsxby never killed Martin Eeny. I did! Or perhaps we both did. I happened to be standing right next to Martin Eeny as the glass hurtled down at him. I then effortlessly caught the glass and, taking this as a sign from heaven that [@ %% I need to figure out if he was also trying to kill Reginald. Possibly he should say "yeah I have always been planning to betray reginald" and reginald can go "I knew it!". Maybe he can be their piano tuner or something.] I began my rampage of death through the flying island."

"It sure seems like a coincidence that you were standing right next to Martin Eeny at that very moment."

"Oh, that. Well, you see, I was following the whims of fate, what I call the Shake. It lets me do things that just work out for no reason. Ever since I saw the northern lights on new year's eve of 0x8ed. And all I have to do is always be slightly drunk!"
