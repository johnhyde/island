The martini killer walked back into the room holding his delightful mixed drink, a Fizz Toddy[$the fizz toddy is like a hot toddy or cold toddy but made with a cola soda as well.][$As the only joke on Skoios goes, a man walks into a bar and asks if the bartender can make him a Hot Toddy. The bartender, owing to the paucity of the bar, says "well, I can't do hot... and I can't do toddy. So: no."[$The inhabitants of Skoios are not noted for their humor.]]. “I bet you're wondering one thing: what are we going to do on this, our wonderful day off? Well the answer is: whatever we want!”
The martini killer contemplated for a moment. "I suppose I should say 'I' instead of 'we', because that's more appropriate."

The martini killer sat down and turned on the phonograph. "You'll enjoy this. It's a classic. An oldy!"

"Never Meant" by American Football played on the phono.[$ This song is both math rock and midwestern emo, if you don't know the song but you still can imagine those genres.] Martinius stared satisfièdly into space. Thomas found it difficult to enjoy the music in this situation. Great song, though.

Marty put on another song. "I love this music. Isn't it too dreamy?" [@that's a Twin Peaks reference] He stood up and began to gently dance to the dulcet tones of "PUSSY !" by Harry Roy & His Bat Club Boys.[$ This song is from 1931.]

"New murder yesterday," said the newsie, "the detective Wmiddle Yone. They found him stuff full[@ another ascended typo.][$On Skoios, this is a turn of phrase meaning "chock full".] of olives. And bizarrely bifurcated. Front-pager. They're calling the guy who did this... the cop killer!"

"Whoa that's crazy," said the beach detective. "Any news about Reginald Digsxby? Or the affair of the Digsxby fortune?"

"I haven't heard anything new lately, sir."

"Thanks." said the beach detective. "Here's a tuppence."

"Thanks," said the newsboy.

The martini killer and Thomas had just finished their third game of cribbagegammon (the martini killer playing cards on Thomas's behalf), and also listening to such classic bops as "Sartorial Panache" by Boboso, "Valatro Villain" by The Barista, "Always Meant (the sequel to 'Never Meant')" by The 22nd Century Flying Island Boyz[@ this one is fictional, I made it up][@ Flying Island takes place in 2301 (with the prologue taking place in 2300), which is the 24th century (and the 23rd century (maybe, depending on how you bound the centuries), respectively), so the 22nd century was a while ago — back when they still used the word "century", probably. I hope their new hexadecimal calendar system has a better word than "century", possibly one corresponding to something like "the 19 hundreds" instead (no off-by-one error).], "Polish Cow" (traditional)[@ this one is a joke that the song "Gdzie jest biały węgorz ? (Zejście)" by Cypis is now unknown in its origins in the future except for its association with dancing cows and Polish], and Beethoven's Ninth.

Marty stood up, brushed himself off, and said, as a final formality: "May I interest you in a snifter, a smack’r’l, a smongo[$ on Skoios, “a smongo” is slang for “a smoke” in the sense of a cigarette, a cigar, a pipe, etc]?"

Thomas once again did not avail himself of this hospitality.

"Alright," said Marty, as though rueful. "*I* have a hot date. Try to get too rowdy[@ This was an accidentally-omitted word error at first, but I'm keeping it as a whimsical thing he said, instead. ~M] while I'm gone, ya hear?" He winked, and then made his way out of the domicile.

Thomas was alone.[@ This is a pointless reference to the game Thomas Was Alone, which I do not actually recommend unless you are, say, a small child (in which case, oh my goodness, what are you doing reading this book? (Based?)) or otherwise easily amused; sateable[$satiable?] with merely a competent presentation of common ideas and easy platforming puzzles.]

He slipped his hands out of the bonds.

The beach detective looked at the sky, pondering. Then he looked down again; to pretend he was just glancing. Perhaps to calibrate his watch by the precise location of the sun, as some very skilled observicians do. He fondled his watch like he was adjusting the time, just in case anyone was looking. But, really, he had been looking at the flying island above of[$some would say, "above"[$ ab’of ~J]] the flying island that was known as Ithica (also "Ithaca"), the private flying island where Reginald Digsxby (habitually) lived. Due to his breeches, he was now of a fit crowd to go a-visiting such jet-setters (-sitters?), but he needed to actually contrive an invitation of some sort for himself. Or did he? The weather was cold on this day, and it reminded him that it was still winter — still Christide, even.[$Much like the late winter that claimed the late life of the late Archbishop Winterpipe lately, The Beach Detective thought to himself. And maybe only he would ever be a one to have pieced together why.] One could wassail up there, perhaps. Perhaps mari lwyd[@I only wrote this phrase because a Welsh mutual friend recently had mentioned it. Soon I'll forget it again, presumably.] — if one had (part of) a horse.

But, in any event, there was time.
