The white wine wine-dark sea[$ white⹀wine-wine⹀dark sea, if you will] was warm as wine[^mulled] and sweet as wine[^mulled] tho’ full of brine ’neath suns that shine on skulls of you and me. The Beach Detective trekked along the shore, parallel to the most beautiful water he had ever seen in his life. The shore of Da Nang. It may be a sort of impractical outfit, but there's quite the vibe in being the only guy on the beach wearing a suit. Even more so if you happen to be carrying a gun.

[^mulled]: mulled

The Beach Detective paused and gazed with great interest at a school of jumping minnows that darted in the water just by shore. They sometimes launched onto the shore with great speed and flopped around as though dying until the waves came back up and caressed them again, allowing them to zip back into the surf. The Beach Detective stood still for several minutes watching one such fish who obstinately tried to zip towards the dry land instead every time, and eventually suffocated and then died. The clear water occasionally rolled over the little fish's corpse afterwards, to no difference. The Beach Detective walked along.

He arrived at his destination, a small table with a white table cloth, about ten yards away from the current line of the tide, at which sat an old man — who may or may not have had functioning legs — drinking tea. They conversed as the waves crashed behind him, the beach detective continuing to stand closer to the water than to the man.

"Have you seen the tombs? & the French colonial administrative buildings?" the older man asked him unceremoniously, but graciously.

"I didn't come here to talk about the sights," said the beach detective. The sun was blinding at the moment, and that was one of the most beautiful sights he had ever seen, and he was facing directly into it, protected only by his dark sunglasses and pale sunblock and loose suit. But he didn't mention this. "I didn't come to talk about the lukewarm waves in which one can bob, nor the luxury hotel which inexplicably also has a pool. I came here to talk to you about our business." He said this not impolitely, just matter-of-factly.

"Hmm! Quite right," said the old man. "The flying island. Dreadful business, that. Say— did you know they have beaches there? Air beaches. Much like our water beaches, but with warm pockets of air. You can even float in them—don't ask me how. One of the miracles of this world."

"They do," commented the beach detective, noncommittally.

The old man drummed his fingers on the table, thinking about the last time he had been on the flying island — whose name was Skoios[@ this is derived from "Some kind of island or something", which I wrote out and then noticed kind of spelled out a word-looking string with its first characters ~M], as all knew — and the thoughts he had had there:

• He didn't care for the city, the flying island of his belovèd youth, as it now knew him too well. His anonymous enemies were surely slipping ever-closer with every second. The only defense he could muster was remaining small and quiet, and thus largely undetected.

• He much preferred the Continents for this reason. Although they were poor,[$ and incontinent [$ it was said]] no long-standing grudges haunted their alleys. There was either no great evil there or it was mercifully ununderstood.

• He tucked in to his Daily Nutrient Soup (a flying island specialty).[@ is this supposed to be a bullet point?? ~~J]

"One of things about being old is that you don't fear or enjoy the same things anymore," he mused to himself, although aloud, wryly. "It's a blessing and a curse, in multiple ways."

He threw the teacup over his shoulder with a feigned but understated devil-may-care attitude. "To business, then," he said.

"To business," the beach detective said.

"Skulduggery and scullery, as usual," said the old man — whose name was of course Lars Squiggle, as all knew — holding out a large red envelope to the beach detective. "Demonry for demons, as we find ourselves to be. The usual scope-and-scalp, old boy. Leave no stone unturned; but turn them all back if you don't find anything under ’em."

The beach detective accepted the envelope with a deep and ceremonial bow.

"Oh... and one more thing..." said the old man. "This case... it involves... the **Digsxbys**[$ Digsxbies?]... will that be a problem?"

"No," the beach detective said after a pause, with a small, evil grin. "No; I think I'll enjoy that."

He walked away down the beach, whistling a happy tune.[@ It's specifically "Life Is Beautiful" from _Deadly Premonition_. That's canon. However, mentioning that would have ruined the pacing of this line. ~M]
