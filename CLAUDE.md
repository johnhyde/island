# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a collaborative novel writing project between John and a mysterious stranger. The project is currently in its initial stages with only a README.md file present.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains:
- `README.md` - Basic project description indicating this is a collaborative novel
- The project structure suggests each chapter will be stored as separate `.txt` files (though none exist yet)

## Development Commands

This is a writing project without traditional software development commands. No build, test, or lint commands are applicable.

## Architecture

This is a creative writing repository rather than a code repository. The intended structure is:
- Individual chapter files in `.txt` format
- Simple file-based organization for the collaborative novel
- No complex architecture or dependencies

## Working with this Repository

When working with this repository:
- Create new chapter files as `.txt` files
- Follow any naming conventions established by the collaborators
- Maintain the collaborative nature of the writing project
- Respect the creative process and existing narrative flow
