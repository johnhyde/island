Islands, today, have bewitching ways about them. Hovering islands now, that's what Reginald Digsx[^1]by likes. Big is best, and huge, frothing, municipal islands wear the cloaks of grandiosity like a newly weft[^2] puppet wears a gossamer veil of impudence. He counts upon his left-hand hand because his right-hand one was lost in The Great War of Succession and Mirth, in Barcelona (his home away from home) — fifteen fingers on the first blast and the rest on the second. He needed to count high—very high—so much so that he had to acquire huge-ass finger-islands for his island-hands.[^3] Nevertheless, he felt a shrewd, creeping, fellow travell[^4]er would soon betray his trust; it was only appropriate, he supposed. That would be the way his story reached its lugubrious end—or would it?!  The deciding factor lay in the calculus of the froth. People respect a good man of one brutally honest calculus. Thus: his forthright[^5] manner of business in the tallying of the froth-people was essential. Mrs. Digsx[^1]by counts double. His wife was, in general, a largely assiduous help-meet, but sadly she was too frothy to be just a single unit. Islands of all sorts must reside within the bosom of such women, as did the basest continents incontinent.

Reginald Digsxby kicked his sniveling heels up on the railing. He was looking out over his railing on his private flying island down upon another flying island below him. Full of the rabble. The frothy polis. Full, as well, of women with admirable bosoms[^bosa] for which perhaps to survey the islands that dwell perhaps within, perhaps pendulously. He was retired, but, like, in a cool way. “Computer!” he ordered his manservant, Manuel Ordinator Computer Gonzalez, “bring me another martini, and sing me a song of that heroic plumber, Mario!” “Certainly, sir,” said Manuel, who was a robot. “Shall I make him kiss Sonic again?” “Of course.” “Very good sir.”

Manuel sang a beautiful and sad song about bisexual mascot[^lawyer] romance whilst Reginald quaffed the procured libation. He wasn't really listening. He was busy staring over the railing at the island below. That damn island. Bewitching in its sexy, sexy city layout, its metropolitan planning. Robert Moses would be proud. Or was he thinking of Albert Speer? Ah, well, whatever. Reginald's gaze cast around furiously, and he continued to count on his one left hand. Somewherever, down there, in the city, in the flying island city, was the man — or woman! — who would betray him. Provided it wasn't his wife; which was frankly pretty likely. On the other hand, his wife was currently shopping down in the city so the caveat was unnecessary. Unlike the betrayal, which was necessary, in the sense of being inevitable (although it would be quite inconvenient and superfluous) — unless he perceived it with sufficient alacrity, and gained the foresight to preëmpt it.

With the final sip of his martini, Reginald Digsxby cast the glass off the edge of the island for to where it plummeted down onto the head of a denizen below named Martin Eeny, who instantly died. A hero's death. Reginald smirked. _Well, that guy wasn't it,_ he thought to himself, sadly.

[^bosa]: bosa?
[^lawyer]: my (fictional) lawyers have advised me to mention that Mario is name of a human man who is the mascot of the Flying Island Plumbing Company, and Sonic is the name of a human woman who is renowned for her justice[^lesb] — she is also the mascot of the Flying Island Bitcoin Storage company. I'm pretty sure a spokesman is technically a mascot.
[^lesb]: and lesbianism[^scandal]
[^scandal]: hence the scandalous bisexuality of the sung sonnet, you see?
