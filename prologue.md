Islands, today, have bewitching ways about them. Hovering islands now, that's what Reginald Digsx[^1]by likes. Big is best, and huge, frothing, municipal islands wear the cloaks of grandiosity like a newly weft[^2] puppet wears a gossamer veil of impudence. He counts upon his left-hand hand because his right-hand one was lost in The Great War of Succession and Mirth, in Barcelona (his home away from home) — fifteen fingers on the first blast and the rest on the second. He needed to count high—very high—so much so that he had to acquire huge-ass finger-islands for his island-hands[^3]. Nevertheless, he felt a shrewd, creeping, fellow travell[^4]er would soon betray his trust; it was only appropriate, he supposed. That would be the way his story reached its lugubrious end—or would it?!  The deciding factor lay in the calculus of the froth. People respect a good man of one brutally honest calculus. Thus: his forthright[^5] manner of business in the tallying of the froth-people was essential. Mrs. Digsx[^1]by counts double. His wife was, in general, a largely assiduous help-meet, but sadly she was too frothy to be just a single unit. Islands of all sorts must reside within the bosom of such women, as did the basest continents incontinent.

Reginald Digsxby kick't his sniveling heels up on the railing. He was looking out over his railing on his private flying island down upon another flying island below him. Full of the rabble. The frothy polis. Full, as well, of women with admirable bosoms[^bosa] for which perhaps to survey the islands that dwell perhaps within, perhaps pendulously. He was retired, but, like, in a cool way. “Computer!” he ordered his manservant, Manuel Ordinator Computer Gonzalez, “bring me another martini, and sing me a song of that heroic plumber, Mario!” “Certainly, sir,” said Manuel, who was a robot. “Shall I make him kiss Sonic again?” “Of course.” “Very good sir.”

Manuel sang a beautiful and sad song about bisexual mascot[^lawyer] romance whilst Reginald quaffed the procured libation. He wasn't really listening. He was busy staring over the railing at the island below. That damn island. Bewitching in its sexy, sexy city layout, its metropolitan planning. Robert Moses would be proud. Or was he thinking of Albert Speer? Ah, well, whatever. Reginald's gaze cast around furiously, and he continued to count on his one left hand. Somewherever, down there, in the city, in the flying island city, was the man — or woman! — who would betray him. Provided it wasn't his wife; which was frankly pretty likely. On the other hand, his wife was currently shopping down in the city so the caveat was unnecessary. Unlike the betrayal, which was necessary, in the sense of being inevitable (although it would be quite inconvenient and superfluous) — unless he perceived it with sufficient alacrity, and gained the foresight to preëmpt it.

With the final sip of his martini, Reginald Digsxby cast the glass off the edge of the island for to where it plummeted down onto the head of a denizen below named Martin Eeny, who instantly died. A hero's death. Reginald smirked. _Well, that guy wasn't it,_ he thought to himself, sadly.

[^bosa]: bosa?
[^lawyer]: my (fictional) lawyers have advised me to mention that Mario is name of a human man who is the mascot of the Flying Island Plumbing Company, and Sonic is the name of a human woman who is renowned for her justice[^lesb] — she is also the mascot of the Flying Island Bitcoin Storage company. I'm pretty sure a spokesman is technically a mascot.
[^lesb]: and lesbianism[^scandal]
[^scandal]: hence the scandalous bisexuality of the sung sonnet, you see?

Then another thought struck him, like a martini glass at terminating velocity: _Maybe that guy was, in fact, it_. What could be more fitting and delectable than that he strike down his betrayer-to-be through pure chance? Or, more properly, through pure skill. It was in his nature to do things that would eventually indirectly solve his problems in ways no one could predict. "Oh, Computer!" he called slyly. "Kindly identify the man who has just died down there, and assemble a dossier on his frothiness. Spare no details!"

"Very good, sir," came the reply, so customary that Reginald barely registered it. He was observing the commotion below. He could just make out the distant wail of a woman who seemed to consider herself bereaved. A crowd was gathering around the corpse, and soon there would be sirens. Later today, or perhaps tomorrow, a detective would come calling—just as a formality of course—but it was still irksome. He was already preparing himself to be irked.

An internal timer of sorts went off in his mind and he held out his hand to receive the dossier from Manuel. It was a nice, plump dossier, the sort he'd normally ask Manuel to summarize for him, but Reginald prided himself on taking every precaution in crucial matters. _Martin Eeny, eh?_, he thought, _let us see..._

Half an hour later, he'd finished a blazing fast, but quite thorough, reading of Martin Eeny's life, and the frothiness thereof, and he didn't like what he'd read. At first he'd read with delighted eagerness; everything was lining up. Mr. Eeny checked all the boxes: motive, means, opportunity. While Reginald hadn't known him by name, they were clearly of the same world. Martin had had the ear of the Imperial Aviation Administration, shifty eyes, and the hands of a working man. The unions respected a man with 10 fingers. Detailed analysis of his upbringing suggested latent moral principles which could easily have led Martin Eeny to first amass power and then turn it against him in favor of The Continents. Those blasted Continents.

The problem was, Reginald didn't buy it. He would have loved to believe that through the very carelessness with which he'd thrown his glass he had decisively cut off his secret enemy, but a few important details didn't add up. First, the very notion that Eeny harbored secret continentalist sympathies hinged on the unsubstantiated account of his days as a schoolboy at Wilhelmchester School for Boys, and particularly his exposure to one Lars Squiggle[^lars], a teacher there at the time. The dossier presented a number of anonymous posts on schoolface.con which corroborated Martin's presence there, and one that told of a special mentor-mentee relationship between Squiggle and Eeny. It told of them taking long walks together. But Reginald, unknown to almost anyone, had hate-visited that school in disguise just a year prior to Eeny's arrival (to learn their ways), and had found Squiggle nearly immobile. His knees were shot from grashing, and while he could hobble to and fro, he certainly wasn't going on any long walks!

He tried to remember if he'd heard anything about Squiggle since then, seen any footage of his gait. Squiggle had mysteriously disappeared in the year 0x8eb, two years after the Eenies got rich, moved to The Islands, and got Martin a proper private tutor. It was hard to believe Squiggle would have got his knees replaced, staunch anticyberneticist that he was (though many an anticyberneticist has changed his tune when faced with crippledom), so Reginald had to assume, in the absence of further evidence, that the rumor of long walks and talks was spurious.

It may seem like a small thing, but Manuel Ordinator Computer Gonzalez was a meticulous researcher, and imprecisions like this were practically unheard of. Combined with a few other weak points in the case, which Reginald could only identify thanks to his many bold, secretive, and improbable exploits, he began to suspect this dossier had been intentionally tampered with. He felt... fear.

♩🎜𝄾♪𝅗𝅥𝅼𝆖 — these were the sounds that Reginald Digsxby heard waft[^waven] from the other room, from inside his island house out onto the veranda. His heart sunk. His wife was back. And while he enjoyed the company of his wife, this meant she could not be above suspicious in the Eeny Dossier case. He counted. What froth! Rapidly, his mind moved through imbrogliations: it would be unwise for his wife, per hypothesis, to signal her presence at this juncture. As this would put her within suspicion. But, she was a clever wench; and, knowing that he would think that, may have done so explicitly to put herself within suspicion as though naïve, so as to remove herself from suspicion thereby. O froth! Oh what a tangled web we weave! Reginald hid the plump & juicy folder behind his back with his hand and strolled into the antechamber of the veranda, whence the sound had woft[^waven]. Perchance.

Once he had entered the antechamber, following the sound, Mrs. Digsxby popped out of the linen closet adjoining the entrance he had just strode[^strone][^stroden] thru, and ambushed him, as it were, from behind, snatching the thicc manifoldifest[^manifoldifest] from out his hand nonchalantly, and began to read it, leafing through, while simultaneously saying “well, what have here?” and ignoring Reginald's yelp “aAAA!” of surprise. Damn! Reginald had forgotten once again that his wife was a master ventriloquist, capable of throwing her voice and other sonic utterances arbitrary differences and directions. 

[^waven]: waven
[^strone]: strone
[^stroden]: stroden?
[^manifoldifest]: this term deserves some explanation: the dossier, or "manifest", of Martin Eeny had been produced — like all Manuelian documents — in triplicate, for error-correction purposes. It was also quite complicated.
