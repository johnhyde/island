“Well hello, beach detective,” said the illustrious shopkeep, raising his eyebrows as though for emphasis. “I'm glad you could find your way… here.”

“Thank you, ‘pointy shoes’ Dugan,” [@ I ended up writing this guy completely different from the guy who has pointy shoes earlier in the story. So maybe he shouldn't be pointy shoes Dugan anymore?%%] said the Beach Detective, entirely unfazed. “What do you have for me?”

“Only the finest pair of breeches, Monsieur!” crooned the shopkeep. “As you know, every high-ranking member of flying island society wears breeches and has been doing so this whole time, canonically. And so if you want to rise out of the gutter-trash ranks of a stinking hard-boiled dick — no offense — and rub shoulders or maybe thighs with the upper crust, you’d better wear the pants[$ on the flying island, “pants” is understood to encompass both trousers and breeches, but not underwear. It's quite like America in that way.] to play the part. So slip out of those trousers and give these puppies a whirl!”

The beach detective doffed and donned appropriately. The breeches were nice.

“Great,” he said, making to pay.

“You know, a funny thing happened along the lines of breeches, down by my friend Barley’s breech shop, about 45, 46 seconds ago,” said the shopkeep, ringing him up, making conversation.

“What's that?”

“A veteran deteteran — I mean, a vetective detective — Jesus — I mean, a veteran detective named Wleft Theare was found strung up on a lamppost, hung by a remarkably strong pair of breeches knotted around his neck, with which he had been presumably strangled. Imagine! The barbarity! Left there to rot!”

“So he will,”[@This suggests a play on words that I think J came up with, fulfilling that. ("Wleft Theare to rot")] said the Beach Detective, “I suppose. But tell me this: was there anything odd about those breeches?”

“Why, yes, I suppose there was. Pajama breeches, they were, and patterned with black martini glasses on a fine white silk[$fun fact: in the flyingislandverse, silk is made from spinning whey and copper into thread.]. And after Labor Day! Oh, also, his body was cut in half in the shape of a martini glass.”

“I'll keep that in mind,” said the Beach Detective. “Thanks.”
