[@ The series of events wherefore which this section is here at the exact place it is and also under the usual word limit is complicated and ultimately uninteresting. Suffice it to say that I wrote it as a clever backup in advance in case I needed to make a contribution while on vacation, and figured I would just start a new chapter in media res of a scene and write a very long speech tag before I had to actually figure out what was going on in the plot, and get off scot-free. ("If I can simply write a 300 word sentence I can hand off to you before I even reach the grammatical subject.") And so this was in a file for safekeeping, ambiguously in the future, then John outplayed me, jumping o'er me on the checkerboard of collaborative literature, by writing his contribution around mine, incorporating and concretizing it.
The chapter Hmm is named after H. M. M., who is in turn named after a placeholder filename John had picked for the chapter previous to this one. He had actually named that hmmm, but obviously that would just be ridiculous. God, imagine a character with those initials. Absurd! Anyway then that file was renamed and also this file was made with its new name, and the great wheel of dharma continues to turn.

"And I'm the rollercoaster tycoon" sayeth the elder Digsxby. And on that topic — which topic we must admit is not evidently clear; as unclear, in fact, as the mud on the bottom of a river that has been kicked up by horses, forming contorted clouds that make streams of their own through the water of the river; which horses and stream H. M. M. Digsxby[$ His name is Hilbert Milbert Mavid Digsxby, btw. [@ I'm reading about David Hilbert rn and, as always, thinking about how weirdly normal his name is. ~M]] the rollercoaster tycoon loved to ride upon and in, or had loved to on and in thereof, in the days of his youth, in the days before the unfortunate accident, in the days when he still had had two legs and the ability to count past that digit when reckoning and the ability, even, to say "count past" instead of "pount cast" when speaking on the subject, and avoid going into fits of stuttering and conniptions thereupon, indelicate little elaborations that, like the allegorical boy und wolf, spoiled everything, by "protesting too much" (a turn of phrase oft misunderstood (or, perhaps, optimisunderstood??) by the soiled masses, the "great unhosed", to take it to mean, I take it, as something to do with protesting against accusations, when really it means offering too much) upon a theme upon which they could not really speak on (boys and wolves and God-cursèd tongue-tied stammerations and their occlusive targets, I mean, respectively) ok this text field is actually pretty small I'll come back later[@ I'm not sure how I feel about this particular type of fourth-wall break.

[@ I guess there probably "shouldn't" be a line break here, by normal paragraph writing rules — but those rules don't know anything about the delicate and important game we're running here, which necessitate these section breaks and markers. ~M]
the elder Digsxby also sayeth all kinds of other stuff that no one really wants to listen to, except inasmuch[$ inäsm̈uch[$inas̈much?]] as they want to perform, for themselves and/or others, respect for elders and appreciation for their presumed wisdom, couched as it might be in drivel and drool. 

Hilbert Milbert Mavid Digsxby was actually a rollercoaster tycoon of sorts, if what he was a tycoon of was a sort of rollercoaster, as some hold. “Rollercoaster? I ‘ardly know ‘er coaster,”[@ are these apostrophes backwards on purpose? ~~M] he’d been fond of saying (before the accident). “Rollercoasters are the emblem of prosperity,” was another thing he’d said, “They are false, like everything else we labor after. They promise safety and sell danger. And the people form long lines to be swindled! There’s nothing the modern man prefers to being deceived.” This was the sort of way he would justify/disparage his business. But, of course, a rollercoaster isn’t even really perfectly safe. It may, on rare occasion, go off the rails and kill everyone, or deprive them of one or more of their legs, or various of their cognitive functions. And so the rollercoaster proves false even in its falsity, an unreliable liar.[@ :chefkiss: ~M][@ If you think about it, unreliable is an anagram of "nebule liar". Or "lune be liar". Or "eel bung liar". That's not why I liked this pargraph so much, though. ~M]

Thomas Metcalf lay stricken in the street, breathless, in terrible pain, barely aware of the rain on his face. He was in love. But also he’d been struck down in a much less figurative sense by a deadly poison. Or at least it felt like it would prove deadly pretty soon. It felt like his insides were being mixed around with sharp knives. It felt like someone had planted a cactus in his skull and it was coming up splendidly. It felt like someone was jabbing him in the ribs with a pointy-toed leather boot.

“Hey!” said a man in pointy-toed leather boots, “Do you know why I’m jabbing you in the ribs?”

Through clenched teeth, with great exertion and annoyance, Thomas suggested that perhaps the man had no respect for the dying.

“That’s right!” he said, enthusiastically, “Anyone can be in the process of dying, but it takes guts to go through with it. Let me know when you’re done; then we’ll talk!” At this he laughed loudly before, concluding, “But seriously, get off my property.” The large man grabbed Thomas by the armpits, hoisted him up onto his feet, and shoved him away from his section of sidewalk, where Thomas’s head had lain.[@ I laughed so many times reading this interaction 😂 ~M]

As he stumbled onward through the excruciating pain behind his eyes (and in his heart—O Prudence![@ ❤️ ~M]), Thomas felt an inkling of Track beneath his feet. He followed it as best as he could, half-blinded by agony. He collided with a door, leaned it open, and stumbled on. He came to be leaning against a table or counter or something and found it in himself to say, “Arthur Fox,” and then, after a pause in which someone may have said something, “April 8th, ’d2”

The pharmacist didn’t like the look of this, but scurried off to get “Mr. Fox” his prescription. On receiving Mr. Fox’s prescription, Mr. Metcalf shakily opened the pill bottle, pocketed one pill, downed another, and returned the bottle to the pharmacist. He said, “Hang on to these for ‘me’, will you?”[$ the quotes were silent, to avoid suspicion]

And so it was that Thomas found himself at a bar, recovering from poison poisoning[$ opposite of what people normally do at bars] next to some geezer talking nonsense out of incoherent wordparts. %%He's talking to H.M.M. but the exercise is doomed because of H's disability. BTW I think H's wife is named Marigold Sunshine (Digxsby).
%%should I pay off arthur fox? hmmmm %%it's just occurred to me that I *could* pay off the pointy boots guy, but it's also perfect as a self-contained guy who is a random jerk to a dying man
%% the track may have killed one of his new friends, and wouldn't necessarily have warned him, since he was still completing the investigation. So he may have inadvertently chosen-his-own-adventure some badder ending.
%%maybe have one of them get martini-killed by the martini killer
%%so i guess he was poisoned at the other bar? So maybe the martinis were poisoned? So The martini killer strikes again?! "I gotta hunt down that bartender," said Thomas, to himself. %%I'm not sure if that guy has a name, but I could name him or someone Bart Ender, after the old joke "if your name isn't bart, you have nothing to fear from the bartender" (cf. "Cal", as well). Could use that as an epigraph as well or instead, perchance.
