"And I'm the rollercoaster tycoon" sayeth the elder Digsxby. And on that topic — which topic we must admit is not evidently clear; as unclear, in fact, as the mud on the bottom of a river that has been kicked up by horses, forming contorted clouds that make streams of their own through the water of the river; which horses and stream H. M. M. Digsxby[@ Hilbert Milbert Mavid Digsxby] the rollercoaster tycoon loved to ride upon and in, or had loved to on and in thereof, in the days of his youth, in the days before the unfortunate accident, in the days when he still had had two legs and the ability to count past that digit when reckoning and the ability, even, to say "count past" instead of "pount cast" when speaking on the subject, and avoid going into fits of stuttering and conniptions thereupon, indelicate little elaborations that, like the allegorical boy und wolf, spoiled everything, by "protesting too much" (a turn of phrase oft misunderstood (or , perhaps, optimisunderstood??) by the soiled masses, the "great unhosed", to take it to mean, I take it, as something to do with protesting against accusations, when really it means offering too much) upon a theme upon which they could not really speak on (boys and wolves and God-cursèd tongue-tied stammerations and their occlusive targets, I mean, respectively) ok this text field is actually pretty small I'll come back later—[@ rare unspaced em-dash] on that topic, I say,

the elder Digsxby also sayeth all kinds of other stuff that no one really wants to listen to, except inasmuch as they want to perform, for themselves and/or others, respect for elders and appreciation for their presumed wisdom, couched as it might be in drivel and drool. 

Hilbert Milbert Mavid Digsxby was actually a rollercoaster tycoon of sorts, if what he was a tycoon of was a sort of rollercoaster, as some hold. “Rollercoaster? I ‘ardly know ‘er coaster,” he’d been fond of saying (before the accident). “Rollercoasters are the emblem of prosperity,” was another thing he’d said, “They are false, like everything else we labor after. They promise safety and sell danger. And the people form long lines to be swindled! There’s nothing the modern man prefers to being deceived.” This was the sort of way he would justify/disparage his business. But, of course, a rollercoaster isn’t even really perfectly safe. It may, on rare occasion, go off the rails and kill everyone, or deprive them of one or more of their legs, or various of their cognitive functions. And so the rollercoaster proves false even in its falsity, an unreliable liar.

Thomas Metcalf lay stricken in the street, breathless, in terrible pain, barely aware of the rain on his face. He was in love. But also he’d been struck down in a much less figurative sense by a deadly poison. Or at least it felt like it would prove deadly pretty soon. It felt like his insides were being mixed around with sharp knives. It felt like someone had planted a cactus in his skull and it was coming up splendidly. It felt like someone was jabbing him in the ribs with a pointy-toed leather boot.

“Hey!” said a man in pointy-toed leather boots, “Do you know why I’m jabbing you in the ribs?”

Through clenched teeth, with great exertion and annoyance, Thomas suggested that perhaps the man had no respect for the dying.

“That’s right!” he said, enthusiastically, “Anyone can be in the process of dying, but it takes guts to go through with it. Let me know when you’re done; then we’ll talk!” At this he laughed loudly before, concluding, “But seriously, get off my property.” The large man grabbed Thomas by the armpits, hoisted him up onto his feet, and shoved him away from his section of sidewalk, where Thomas’s head had lain.

As he stumbled onward through the excruciating pain behind his eyes (and in his heart—O Prudence!), Thomas felt an inkling of Track beneath his feet. He followed it as best as he could, half-blinded by agony. He collided with a door, leaned it open, and stumbled on. He came to be leaning against a table or counter or something and found it in himself to say, “Arthur Fox,” and then, after a pause in which someone may have said something, “April 8th, ’d2”

The pharmacist didn’t like the look of this, but scurried off to get “Mr. Fox” his prescription. On receiving Mr. Fox’s prescription, Mr. Metcalf shakily opened the pill bottle, pocketed one pill, downed another, and returned the bottle to the pharmacist. He said, “Hang on to these for ‘me’, will you?”[$ the quotes were silent, to avoid suspicion]
