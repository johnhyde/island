    # A sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job.
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out your repository code.
      # This action checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE,
      # so your job can access it.
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Make the build script executable.
      # This is a good practice to ensure the script has the necessary permissions to run.
      - name: Make build script executable
        run: chmod +x ./build.sh

      # Step 3: Run the build script.
      # This command executes the script located in the root of your repository.
