[@ Since I only began this chapter so I could include my conceit about T and G trying to figure out what the heck a PDF is, and have no idea where it's going, I named it kinda at random.

{"Private domicile...furnishings?"}

"Pickled dunkleosteus fry."[$ Meaning, of course, the freshly hatched young of the recently unxtinct dunkleosteus fish, preserved in some acidic sauce or brine: an exquisite delicacy[$ Greatly prized for the tender texture of the flesh, the exacting skill required in its preparation, and the absolutely swampgarbage taste.] on the islands, although the dish is known there as Jumbo Whoppers.]

"Prompt...delivery...fast?"

"I'm telling you, it's gotta be pickled dunkleosteus fry."

"Omnigus, what the hell does that even--"[$ Seriously Thomas, read the footnotes. You're psychic, aren't you?] Thomas stopped abruptly. Someone had just mischaracterized his abilities.[@ I don't know how you guys will feel about this, but I really like it. ~C] He shook himself.

[J; 336 words]

“What the heck does that even mean?” Thomas said, completing his thought and self-censoring the word “hell” for some reason.

Gurston Butterman wasn’t listening. He was deep in thought. He was swimming in deep waters of cognition, freediving now, pressurizing dangerously... fearlessly... Thomas poked him in the shoulder. His eyes snapped open. “I’ve got it!” he exclaimed.
“Please don’t say, ‘pickled dunkle’o’saurus fries,’ again.”
“What we need is a good morning’s sleep!” said ~retsub-notrug satisfiedly and satisfactorily. Thomas was perfectly satisfied with this answer and gave no further thought to whether PDF stood for “Prudence’s Delicate Fingers” or “Paul Died Forlornly” or “Please Don’t Faint” or anything like that. In fact, they both put far from their minds that ill-fated print job and the mysterious attractive woman in the jpg and headed out the door and checked into the nearest hotel and went to sleep.

Up in heaven, Paul Eeny was having his moral nature rectified, as did all new arrivals. He was a bit upset about having been murdered at first, but then he remembered that dear old Mart was up here somewhere and they’d be able to hang out soon. What had he really had to live for down there anyway? At least this way he wouldn’t scandalize everyone by getting really drunk at Martin’s funeral/celebration of life or whatever they did. Nor would he soberly annoy the widow by stealing the eulogical[@ I really liked “eulogical” ~C][@ 💯 ~M] show. Not that he probably would have done any of that anyway. He wondered about what sort of funeral he might have, whether anyone had found his body yet... In fact, how was he up here if he was still down there waiting to be cremated or whatever he’d agreed to in the small print of his life insurance policy?[@ I just find it amusing to imagine that the life insurance people care how your body is disposed of.] And would that policy be paid out to Angelica[@ Angelica Pulte Eeny a.k.a. A. Pulte Eeny a.k.a. Appletini] since its intended beneficiary had died first? Just then, a rectifying angel turned up one of the moral rectifier knobs and Paul lost his train of thought.

[@ I wonder if Paul is still gay after having his moral nature rectified in heaven. Whatever your view is on the morality of homosexuality (eg I think it's fine but the Bible seems pretty against it), it's also unclear to me if you'd lose your sinful urges in Heaven or just gain the clarity to resist them. (Which I guess he was already doing or something?) Those urges in particular seem biologically based to me, and it's also not clear to me if your heaven body is also a perfect body or just a copy of your shitty earth body. Maybe you don't get your perfect body until the end of time when Jesus comes back and Eden descends upon the earth. You also might be incorporeal. ~M]
[@ I was also wondering about this, and decided not to address it ~J]

[@ I was also fond of the fact that the moral rectification happens to you in heaven when an angel presses a button on a machine. :i_cant: ~M] [@ "pay attention to the man behind the curtain", they probably say ~M]

A sharp, dull knock piercingly penetrated Thomas's[$Thomi?] sensorium, instantly waking him up. He estimated he'd been asleep for three hours now and — as he always was after waking — he felt fit as a fiddle and chipper as a bull in a china shop.[@chip 'er? I 'ardly know 'er! ~M] He effortlessly, refreshèdly, put on his outerpants[$ overpants? überpants?] and then a shirt and then walked to the door and opened it.

"Good evening," said the fat man, anachronistically. He was a bit short, and wore a suit and some kind of formal hat. The fat man — understand: this man was 1970s fat; by the standards of, say, 2020s USA he was a non-euphemistic “pudgy”, or perhaps (as had in fact been occasionally remarked about him by certain more-corpulent friends on the occasion of seeing him disrobèd in the baths) “not fat” — the fat man, Regular Belasco, had about him a whimsical air of decay. An almost-affected world-weariness. "May I come in?" he asked Thomas.

"Come in," Thomas stepped aside.

The fat man came into the room, and produced a bottle of red white and two crystal goblets from under his arm. He set the latters on the table and decorked the former, pouring it in 'em. It made a pleasant pouring sound. It looked old.[$ old is good for a wine[$ much like for a teenager AMIRITE FELLAS? LADIES? THIS GUY KNOWS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! (PUBESCENCE AND THE NATURAL END OF MAN) ~M][@ I can't tell if you intended the implied joke to be 'old is good for a teenager' or 'teenagers are good for a wine (whine)'. I think it wasn't 'old is teenager for a wine' so I'm going to go with that one. ~C[@ In making this annotation, it is clear I am not the 'THIS GUY' referred to elsewhere in this annotation tree. ~C]] ~M] "I hope you accept this apology for my interrupting your beauty sleep," he said.

"Oh boy!" said Thomas, licking his lips, imagining drinking this good-looking wine.

"Hey Thomas, do you know if there's ice?" asked Bus, slipping through the door that joined their two rooms.

"I have no idea, but you've come just in time for what promises to be a very significant conversation, Bus!"

"Oh, great!"

"I'm afraid I only brought the two glasses..." said the fat man.

"Luckily I brought my own, since I was looking for ice," said Bus, holding out his normal, non-wine glass. The fat man dutifully poured.

"Thomas, I have some urgently significant information for you," said the fat man, once all had sipped a little. He handed Thomas an envelope of photographs. "It concerns Lord Fitzthistlewits, and the case of the martini killer."[@ How does the fat man know this appellation!? ~C]

Thomas opened the envelope and leafed through them. All pictures of Lord Fitzthistlewits. Pictured at various parties and public events. In each, he was holding a martini glass.

"This is... just a guy drinking martinis. That doesn't mean anything. They're a completely normal drink, you know."

The fat man shook his head. "Look again, Thomas." [@My intention is not that Lord F is the martini killer — that would be ridiculous. But what happens next, to establish what the real connection is, is out of my hands.~M] [@ Perhaps Lord f will be wearing The same martini lapel pin that the martini killer is ~M]

[C; 783 words]

Thomas selected a photo up at random, huffed on it, and buffed it with his newly-donned shirt. The ol' huff-n-buff. In so doing, a tiny detail caught his eye. "I say," he said, accurately, "he's wearing the same martini lapel pin that the Martini Killer wears."

"True, but that's completely coincidental and unimportant."

"Oh."

"They are, as you yourself noted, a completely normal drink."

"I see."

"Barely worth remarking on. You've seen the martini killer?"

Thomas peered at the photo in his hand, at the others he'd set down, trying to see the significat[@ intentional. obscure noun form ~C], if it wasn't the lapel pin thing, which Thomas still felt might be related to the case. "Oh yes," he said distractedly. "Eclectic taste in music. He thinks I'm better at cribbagegammon than I am."

"Thomas was kidnapped by the martini killer a couple days ago and escaped just a few hours ago," Gus explained, taking pity on the fat man's look of bemusement[@ A word whose definition never seems to fit for me. I can't really picture a 'bemused' expression, even though I know what it means.[@ Or do I? ~C] ~C].

"Egad," muttered the fat man, removing the folded handkerchief from his suit pocket and wiping his brow[$ yes, really. He really did. I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't written it with my own eyes.]. "Then we might not be safe here."

"Hmm?" Thomas glanced up from his perusal, frowning slightly. "Well, of course we aren't safe! You're participating in the investigation of an active serial killer, Mister...Belasco." He increased the intensity of his gaze at the still-visibly=nervous fat man and waved a dismissive hand. "You still have a good fifty-odd years left, if *that* eases your mind at all."

"R-really?" sputtered the fat man.

"Or hours. The Track sometimes confuses those," said Thomas vaguely, returning to his scrutiny of the photographs.

"Mr. Eeny did that too. Intuited my name, if not my time of death." Mr. Belasco refolded his handkerchief and replaced it in his pocket. "It's rather unsettling." His silhouette, cast by the setting sun in the south-west facing windows and framed rather strikingly by the frames of those self-same windows, mimicked his actions.

Only the fact that he was already standing (that pernicious habit!) kept Thomas from leaping to his feet. "You've seen Paul? He's alive!?"

The fat man gestured to the envelope. "He gave that to me on Tuesday evening[@ I looked up what day of the week Jan 1 2301 will be, assuming the day-of-the-week conventions are unchanged by whatever changed the base the year is expressed in. I ain't explaining that in the text—the readers can look it up if they want to, it's easy. ~C]. To bring to you, here at this time—"

"*These are from Paul?*" Thomas—it has to be said—shrieked. "Why didn't you mention that sooner?" he asked of both the fat man and the Track.

The fat man was growing a trifle irritated. "He said that they would have special significance to you, but the important information is obvious." He went on to point out and explain the important and obvious information[@ which is definitely known and not just being skipped over by a barely-competent hack to be figured out by better writers :P ~C].

Thomas was barely listening. _*Special significance...* But he'd already altered the order of the photos, their orientations... "Dunkle!" he snapped, interrupting Belasco. "Shuffle these."

"On it, boss." Gus drained his glass and started rearranging the photos any old how.

Thomas stared at him, unseeing, and ignoring the gaping fat man. He didn't doubt that there was some useful information in the photos' surface-level contents. But as soon as the fat man had relayed that the photos were from Paul, he'd been struck by a spasm of certainty: there was some other information in this envelope. Information only someone like him—like *them*—could possibly glean.

The time displayed on any visible clocks? The words legible on the banners in the pictures of civic events? Express the orientation of the picture in binary, from 00 to 11, and concatenate into an ascii string? Interpret the martinis as morse code, with the garnish (olive or lemon wedge) distinguishing the symbols and those martinis without garnish delimiting the letters?

*That one.*

Seriously?

*Yes!*[@ I'm intending this to be Thomas talking to himself, about his perceptions of the direction of The Track, rather than The Track communicating with Thomas in some quasi-verbal way. The difference might be largely a matter of perspective. ~C]

"Alrighty, boss, here you go." Gus passed the stack over to Thomas, who began flipping through them rapidly. Lemon, lemon, olive, none, olive...

In a few seconds, he'd come up with

..- --. .-.- .-.[@ I would like these to be center-justified, but I don't know how to do that. ~C]

"'Ugær'?" Thomas said aloud, returning from his quick jaunt through his memory palace. "Does that mean anything to either of you?"

The fat man stammered his failure to comprehend anything that was going on, least of all whatever Thomas had just said.

"'Ugæret' means 'unfermented' in Danish," Bustopher[@ You can change this if you wish, John. ~C] volunteered.

Thomas noted that for later consideration, but it seemed unlikely... "Reverse the polarity," he muttered. "I've always wanted occasion to mutter that."

-.. ..- -.-. -.-[$duck][@ Originally I put the translation of this on the next line in the main text. Now I'm not sure if it should go there, or in a footnote, or be left as an exercise to the reader. ~C]

In the squares of dying sunlight on the wall, the shadow of Thomas grabbed the arms of the shades of Bus and Belasco and dragged them down into the darkness below the light, even as the square which had held Thomas's center of mass fractured into an ephemeral spiderweb of, again, striking beauty, if anyone had been in a position to take notice.

[@ This could be a gunshot, which could explain the title. We'll see. ~C]
