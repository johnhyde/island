Metcalf rubbed his wrists[$wris'ts?][$rizzeds?]. While he wished he could immediately jump into doing cool spy-type stuff, having freed himself from the bonds, which was presumably The Track, maybe (still no new neural news on that, either way) Thomas first desperately needed to pee.

It was what you might call a V.I.P. (Very Important Pee), given that he had been unconscious since January 1st and it was now (according to his cool watch[$On Skoios, the most popular model of watch is a combination pseudo-sundial and orrery, which gives you the time and date in a facsimilistically embodied way. But that's neither here nor there.[$ more relevantly, all watches on Skoios were completely tamper-evident, so it was pretty unlikely that the martini killer had been able to alter his timekeeping in any way.][$Thomas's profession didn't require him to wear a watch, of course, but their metal rings beguile.]]) January 3rd, albeit early in that day. He'd only been awake for a couple hours now but the whole time he was bursting for a piss. Luckily, he was very good at holding it in.[$ He'd never even had a yeast infection, a traditional downside of holding it in. This was because he was a man and not a woman.]

Thomas's piss was very frothy today, he noticed as he pissed into the toilet, which naturally he did while standing up so he could continue to case the place for clues at the same time. Clues, and also maybe something to eat. Damn,[$ There is canonically no hell in the flyingislandverse, nor perdition nor eternal obliteration (the ex-patriot re-tourists from heaven had explained this) so this swear-word wasn't considered very serious any more, even by the most fundamentalist of religiacs.] he was thirsty. He had no idea why sometimes piss was frothy and sometimes it wasn't. Possibly something to do with the "froth quotient" scientists[$damn eggheads] had postulated about the human soul, which is canonically stored in the kidneys. It was something to do with your moral nature, some kind of parameter of perfidy. Well, no time to wonder about that any longer! There were mysteries to be uncovered now! Probably.

As Thomas zipped up and wash't his hands, feeling great relief, he thought about the old joke they often told around the town about the man who tried to impress a woman at a bar by holding a hot coal with his bare hands, with no complaint, to show how tough he was, until she left and then he said "aaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!".

He chuckled to himself. He loved these island jokes.

Thomas made himself a sandwich and drank about 3 quarts of water. He could feel the feeling start to return to his legs, which was nice. However, he was currently coming up bupkis for real clues about the rooms. There didn't even seem to be any identifying effects stowed therein. Golly, the only picture in the whole livingspace was a framed picture of Lord Fitzthistlewitz[@This is a reference to Fitzthistlewitz. Since the Fitzthistlewitz is no longer in use, I've decided to make him a fictional personage in this story. How his station has acscended.], mayor of Skoios. All citizens of Skoios were provided with such a picture, gratis, as it was thought to encourage civic pride and also loyalty to their humble[$ & handsome] mayor-for-life. Thomas kissed the picture of Lord F. absent-mindedly — as this was the custom among all right-thinking people — and thought hard about his next move.
