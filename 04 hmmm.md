Francesca ***Metcalf*** Digsxby was so tired. The botched botched betrayal and it’s[sic] consequences had been a disaster for her personally. She felt an overwhelming burden of guilt over her husband’s mysterious disappearance.[^attorney] She couldn’t really blame herself, if she was being fair. She’d done what she thought was right, and she’d arranged everything with excellence and even panache, but one spot of bad luck (or was it poor judgment?) had spoiled everything in an instant.

[^attorney]: her attorneys have advised me to maintain a certain ambiguity about why exactly this is.

Essentially, her Pookie was not supposed to have disappeared. He wasn’t even supposed to have fallen unconscious at the moment of betrayal. It would seem that Francesca had seriously underestimated the delicacy of his nerves, and for this she might never forgive herself, although even now it was hard to believe. But he _had_ fallen unconscious, and when he’d awoken he’d shocked both her and Manuel (if indeed that machine can be shocked) by launching immediately into a violent flailing, by which we must assume he hoped to attain freedom from what we must assume he assumed to be his captivity. As fate would have it, in one of his blind strikes he impaled his one hand on one of Manuel’s utility spikes.

Well, I won’t bore you with the details, but basically things got out of hand very quickly from there. In particular, a good amount of Reginald’s blood got out of his hand very quickly. But also in a general sense. It became clear that certain things[^things] would need to be done to recover any semblance of control over the situation, which things were done, which Francesca found, ultimately, very tiring.

[^things]: those pesky attorneys, I tell ya

So she was relieved when she finally found herself with a moment to let her hair down and not do anything specific for an hour.

After 15 minutes listlessly humming to herself, throwing that around the room and rooms as always, she decided to take an inventory of the house, the flying island. She started by listing to herself all of the boats that were in the house, which were named after the boats in the Iliad. Once she was done with this, she decided to take an inventory of every room of the house. There was the galley, of course. And then the galley of a different sense. And then the gallery. And so on. She passed into the morning room. Pray it would never become a mourning room — or perhaps it would... And then, of course, was the secret dungeon, in which Mr Digsxby was being kept. What was left of him,[$How much of him is left? Maybe it's all of him. Wouldn't you like to know!] so to speak. But it was not good to think of it now. It would simply lead her to distraction in this, her moment of solace and solitude, and she'd thought about it enough in the past, oh, indeterminate hours.

The hulking inanimate carapace of Manuel the big robot hulked over her. Hulk, hulk.

"Will you be needing anything, Madam?" asked Manuel, in his distinctive yet non-unpleasant robotic-toned roboty voice.

Francesca, who was sometimes called Fran to her friends or Franny to her family or 'Cesca to her lover or sometimes for apparently no reason at all Eleanor, didn't open her eyes. "There's no need to do that voice. We're alone."

"Of course, madam," said Manuel, in a distinctively non-distinctive voice.

"Oh, come off it!" said Fran, weakly throwing a small pillow at the overgrown tin can. With a *bzt, bzhrt, zhuu* noise that seemed to be produced by a human mouth, the front of the robot-suit's face-visor opened, revealing the handsomely mustached human visage of the ultimately enfleshèd Manuel Ordinator Computer Gonzalez.
