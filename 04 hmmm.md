Francesca ***Metcalf*** Digsxby was so tired. The botched botched betrayal and it’s[sic] consequences had been a disaster for her personally. She felt an overwhelming burden of guilt over her husband’s mysterious disappearance.[^attorney] She couldn’t really blame herself, if she was being fair. She’d done what she thought was right, and she’d arranged everything with excellence and even panache, but one spot of bad luck (or was it poor judgment?) had spoiled everything in an instant.

[^attorney]: her attorneys have advised me to maintain a certain ambiguity about why exactly this is.

Essentially, her Pookie was not supposed to have disappeared. He wasn’t even supposed to have fallen unconscious at the moment of betrayal. It would seem that Francesca had seriously underestimated the delicacy of his nerves, and for this she might never forgive herself, although even now it was hard to believe. But he _had_ fallen unconscious, and when he’d awoken he’d shocked both her and Manuel (if indeed that machine can be shocked) by launching immediately into a violent flailing, by which we must assume he hoped to attain freedom from what we must assume he assumed to be his captivity. As fate would have it, in one of his blind strikes he impaled his one hand on one of Manuel’s utility spikes.

Well, I won’t bore you with the details, but basically things got out of hand very quickly from there. In particular, a good amount of Reginald’s blood got out of his hand very quickly. But also in a general sense. It became clear that certain things[^things] would need to be done to recover any semblance of control over the situation, which things were done, which Francesca found, ultimately, very tiring.

[^things]: those pesky attorneys, I tell ya

So she was relieved when she finally found herself with a moment to let her hair down and not do anything specific for an hour.
