The beach detective stood aloof in the middle of the floor of the morning commuter transport ship[^ship] headed to the flying island. He held no seat nor structure to steady himself against the shudders and turbulence of the ride; he just stood firm. He was surrounded by the peasants, of various stripes and qualities, of the flying island, which — despite freemen and free agents — were for some reason called villeins. The Flying Villeins. 97% of the population. And here he was among them, vagabone, vagābundus. But he paid them no mind. Instead, he looked out at the beautiful bright gently-churning ocean, under the indefatigable and undefiable[$undefyable?] Sun that precluded him from looking at half of his possible field of vision. He thought about what the old man had told him the previous time he had been on an assignment to the flying island Skoios[^pronunciation]:

[^ship]: This amphibious sea- and then air- ship[@ it goes on the sea a while and then takes off into the air to get to the island] was called an aeroömnibus; or "’bus", for short.[$ Or "aerō omnia vincit" for long.[@A play on "labor omnia vincit"/"amor omnia vincit" ("work conquers all"/"love conquers all"), this other version actually means "a wicker basket binds up all" (a vinciō/vincō pun). Evidently, they don't think much of this ship!][$"Omnia mea mecum porto"[@ this is a famous latin expression, meaning "All that is mine I carry with me", which is kind of a pun in this context since the ship actually carries a lot.], the ship would have said if it could talk, which it cannot.[@Something something _Porco Rosso_, porto meacum...]]]

[^pronunciation]: The beach detective tended to pronounce this name /sko.i.os/ [skow.ij.ows]; the old man pronounced it /skoj.os/ [skɔj.əws]; the natives of said island tend to pronounce it /sko.i.os/ [sko.i.os] these days[$although, oddly, they didn't tend to pronounce any other vowels in such a non-english style.] although some old-timers still held to the pronunciation /ski.os/ [ski.os]. Thomas Metcalf pronounced it /sko.i.os/ [skɐw.ij.ɐws].

Lars Squiggle had just finished telling him a long story about how he had turned, from his islandish youth, to Continentalism[$revitalizing it thereby]. The beach butler brought another cup of tea. Then:

"Only I and other old monsters finally understand virtue," said Lars, "instead of a confusèd morass of vague associations."

"Virtue, hmm?" said the beach detective.

"Virtue is the disposition to do the good," said Lars. "But what is the good? It may surprise you. Sometimes the few must die to save the many. And sometimes the many must die for the few."

"Mirth and Succession," quipped the beach detective.

"Indeed," said Lars. "And only those steeped in time and wisdom can truly understand the path to the good, the way around the trick knives of this unholy world, the unintuitive intuitions that bear[$or perhaps he had said "bare"] the birth of the better world."

"Yeah, I don't really go for that," said the beach detective.

"Fate often has interesting plans us," said Lars, "Even those of us who don't feel privy to the machinations of its fingers... you may be one such..."[@ My intention here was to write something that reflects upon the theme of fate, although neither of these characters are Intuitive like Thomas; Lars has simply achieved wisdom, which allows him to make rational(?) inferences akin to Intuition, although much less mystically. ~M]

And after that time, the beach detective had left the old man on the beautiful beach, and had completed an assignment on the flying island, of no particular consequence, and had returned to the continents, and had continued to spend all his money on fast women and fine booze — or at least quick women and good booze —, and all was well, more or less. No particular plan from fate seemed to lie in his future. Which was just as well to him.

He grappled with the urge to wreak vengeance from time to time, but mostly overcame it. There would be so many to be venged upon[@ note that "venge" is just an obsolete form of the word "avenged", and means the same thing. Which is why i had to add the preposition "upon". The beach detective doesn't want to avenge many people; he wants to wreak vengeance upon many people. ~M]; it would be a big hassle. Frankly, it was above his pay grade. Although, he did dream of cosmic justice. Sick with the desire for it, some nights.

He took his gaze from the sunny scene and regarded the object in his hands. His investigations notebook, a black⹀pleather‐covered number with his notes inside scrawled in a cramped Gregg shorthand. It was open to a page about three quarters of the way through the book, the current page, and the two-page spread was nearly black with his scribblings. The beach detective only used the notes as a cue, an aide-mémoire. His mind kept all the details of an investigation like an iron trap. For whatever reason, his mind wouldn't let him forget them.

That's not to say that all of his investigations were successful. The Beach Detective often thought of investigations in the terms of the Tide. The tide goes in and the tide goes out. Despite foolish proclamations to the contrary, no man can turn the tide. You'd have to be God.[@ The Tide is kind of like the beach detective's Track, as part of his function as a foil. ~M[@ unlike the Groove that Paul is established to have, I don't think the Tide actually perceptibly influences the beach detective, although fate still works on him (and might explain why he never forgets a case). ~M]]

The beach detective closed his notebook and returned it to his interior jacket pocket.

He admired the view once again. Then, he looked around the ’bus, absently. He met the gaze of a man who did not look away.

Their gazes rested on each other. The beach detective had been expecting this man to look away, as you do when your gaze accidentally meets a stranger's in a public place. But the man did not look away. "Good morning!" said the man, with a bright and beautiful small smile.

The beach detective's heart leapt. "Good morning," he said back.

The man walked the short distance away from the wall to stand next to the beach detective, joining him in freestanding. The man had a vivacious energy, thick black glasses, and oddly protrudinous nose, and a big black mustache that differed significantly in color from his beard.[@ 🥸 ~J]

"Enjoying the sunshine?" the man asked.

"*Desperately,*" affirmed the beach detective.

The man looked at the sunny scene himself. "You know," he said, "many on the flying island are equating the Sun to Michaelmas Term — that famous late zeppliner, you know? Term J. Michaelmas, I suppose they would call him, in their name order. The sun, the eyes of Term J. Michaelmas — &, of course, God." [@ this is a _The Great Gatsby_ reference, and also a callback to the previous chapter ~M]

"I am familiar with that zepplino," said the beach detective. "I'm surprised people on the island are still talking about him. He died nigh-three years ago[$ The beach detective knew exactly how long it had been. Two years, eleven months, and 16 days.]. Or..." he hesitated a little, and said the next sentence trailing off, in decreasing volume and convincingly feigning an uncertain and self-dismissive tone of voice: "so they say..."

"You don't seem that certain," said the stranger, studying the beach detective's face with a passionate interest.

"I was familiar with the details of that incident," said the beach detective, trying not to suggest that he had worked that case for an employer (which he had), "and it seemed... to me... that there were a couple details that never quite lined up. So, who knows what happened? He's probably dead, though."

The stranger gave his train of thought a little nod of acknowledgment. "I see." He looked out at the sun again. "Anyway, I'm not surprised people are still talking about him: he was unforgettable."

"So they say," said the beach detective, thinking back to all those women he'd interviewed.

"His middle name was Juliet, you know that? ‘Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon’![$ _The Tragedie of Romeo and Juliet_, by VVilliam Shakespeare (act 2, scene 2)[@ Shakespeare plays probably didn't initially have act divisions, but they're useful for reference, much like Bible "versification".][@ The more obvious, and preceding, line from the play is "It is the East, and Juliet is the sun", but that's kind of bland and not as fun — although including it here would definitely help people who don't get this reference get it. ~M]] Ha!"

"Huh!" said the beach detective. "I'd never heard that."

"Then wear the gold hat, if that will move her; / a rose by any other name would smell as sweet,"[@ this is a _Great Gatsby_ reference before the slash and a _Romeo and Juliet_ reference after the slash. And by reference I mean direct quote ~M] mused the stranger.

The beach detective looked out again at the sun-glistening water and beautifully-illumed quickly-approaching flying island. But he could not pay attention to it, for he was distracted. By his own heart. Much like the young lecher whose glasses inöpportunely fog up due to his own excited body heat upon coming across some unäshamèd mermaids, he could not admire the scenery for his own passion.

There was nothing for it. It was love at first sight.

"You doing anything later?" the beach detective asked, significantly.

"Oh," said the stranger, quite chipperly, "are you asking me out, on a date?"

"Yeah."

"No thanks; I don't swing that way." [@ I'm not 100% fond of this locution ~M]

"Well..." said the beach detective, who himself mostly preferred women but was willing to make the occasional exception for a striking personage[@ I initially wrote "striking visage", but I realized I haven't really justified this, and it's really the manner of being of this person that he is attracted to. ~M], "maybe I could hold you chastely? It is the style on the island, after all..."

"Oh no. I've fallen for that one before. All the multitudinous women who beg me to come to their boulevard[@ I typo'd boudoir really bad and thought it was funny to keep this spellcheck suggestion ~M], just to be reassured in this lonely world, just to be held, and then the kissing starts, chastely at first and then less so, and then the heavily petting, and then a prominence rises, rises like ‘Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti’[$"Africa", by Toto][@ This is a quote noted by music likers the world over for being a line that, if you think about it, describes a mountain that is not, in fact, in a certain place as being quite like another mountain that also is not in that place. ~M] — and who's to say whose prominence that would be? No, sir, I shan't let you put me into a situation, ohoho!"

"Alright," said the beach detective.

"Thanks for the offer, though," said the stranger. "You seem like a nice guy."

"Thanks," said the beach detective, still feeling deflated.

Moments passed in silence. The beach detective studied the waves and the nearing flying island. His new acquaintance continued to look at him, unabashed.

"... Well..." said the beach detective, "we're nearing the island now. It was a pleasure to meet you." He stuck out his right hand.

"Likewise," said the cheerful stranger, shaking the hand vigorously but not ungently.

They put their hands back in their pockets. "What's your name?" asked the beach detective, as an afterthought.

"My name?" said the stranger. He paused, clearly coming up with a lie. "Marvinlust Maoi.[@ This character name is based on thinking of the phrase "marvelous MAOI" (Monoamine oxidase inhibitors), which is why "Maoi" then makes several references in a row to the properties of MAOIs. He likens himself to MAOIs because of his zest for life. His lust for life, if you will. ~M] At your service! Mwahaha!"

"OK," said the beach detective.

"Don't eat cheeses around me-ses — if you pleases! Hee hee (ses)!" ~~ses~~ ~~says~~ said the mysterious stranger, enamored with his new name. He smiled self-satisfièdly. "Do you need any pills?" he offered.

"No," said the beach detective.
