A collaborative novel between John and a mysterious stranger

Each chapter is a separate markdown file?

No AI nor LLM has been used on this project, at least so far (except in the creation of the .gitignore).

## Rules

John and the mysterious stranger will take turns writing between 300 and 1500 words and handing off to the other. Ideal cadence is one handoff daily, but it's not a big deal if someone delays a few days. 4 days means one of us should consider saying something passive aggressive. This began 2025-07-20, although it was a get-together, as mentioned below.

Sometimes we have a little get-together and write alternating words, as a treat. This counts as the handoff (although it could be handed off to the either author upon mutual agreement, since a get-together is sort of both and neither in terms of writing, and thus a wildcard). The first of these was 2025-07-20.
