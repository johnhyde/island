A collaborative novel between John and a mysterious stranger

Each chapter is a separate .txt file?

## Rules
John and the mysterious stranger will take turns writing between 300 and 1500 words and handing off to the other. Ideal cadence is one handoff daily, but it's not a big deal if someone delays a few days. 4 days means one of us should consider saying something passive aggressive.

Sometimes we have a little get-together and write alternating words, as a treat.
