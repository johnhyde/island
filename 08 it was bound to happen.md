Francesca opened the front door. It was about 9:30am and the sun would ordinarily be only minimally obstructed by a few trees from hitting her squarely in the face as she stood facing East. Term[$ Michaelmas] had suggested they orient their private island in this way, so that they could always step outside into direct sunshine first thing in the morning. Reginald had approved of this for some hidden reason that wasn't the normal reason, and Francesca had approved of it for the normal reason as well as a hidden, also normal, reason. “This is well known to support a healthy circadian rhythm,” she’d said. They'd been accustomed to following Skoios around like a cartoon storm cloud for some time, and Skoios had been democratically puttering about the mid-Pacific for some time,[$ perhaps to minimize proximity to any continents? or perhaps as a failed compromise due to a naïve averaging of preferred coordinates? The operational shell of the democratic process was shockingly opaque for a city so young] so when there were no clouds, the sun rose nakedly from the sea like a giant peeping eye, bare of land-lids or tree- or building-lashes. Staring contests with the sun were like staring contests with Dr Michaelmas: dazzling, illuminating, painful, brief, and hopeless.

But anyway, in this case the sun was blocked by the hat and head of an unfamiliar man or woman in a trench coat. The silhouette reached up to tip its hat and mumbled, androgynously, “Good morning, madam. I’m” and then something that sounded like, “Georgia Mann, Unintuitive Detective,” or possibly, “George, a man; I’m doin’ a ‘detective’”[^culture] Following this was heard, “I’d like to ask you a few questions, if you don’t mind.”

[^culture]: In their culture neither First + Last, nor Either + “a man/woman”, is a customary way for an Officer of the Law to introduce himself (or herself?)

Francesca wondered why they’d sent a new detective when they’d already sent whatever-their-names-were yesterday after she’d reported Reginald missing. She was just about to say as much, when the entity before her spoke up again in that low-for-a-woman but not-terribly-mannish voice: “You may be wondering where my partner is.”

“I’m right here,” said Wright Heare, a small man, stepping out from behind the mysterious detective who had hitherto completely eclipsed him (and the sun).

“This is Detective Heare, my partner.”

Francesca figured she’d better say something before things got too much further along. “Well, of course I’m happy to answer any questions you may have, but the lads who came by yesterday were very thorough.”

“Ah, well, you see,” said Officer Mann, slyly, or perhaps shyly, “We’re from Homicide.”

[@ The joke here is that when the unintuitive detective is around, unintuitive things happen, including section breaks where the next section picks up right where the last one left off.]

Francesca was taken aback, but said calmly, “I suppose you’d better come in then,” and motioned for them to do so, with the particular air of one who is gracious even in the deepest depths of distress (for example, her husband being missing, oh where could he be, I hope he’s ok, etc.).

Officer Heare immediately set about finding the bathroom, not taking time to ask where it was. His keen hearing led him in the right direction, picking up on the faintest hiss of some sort of plumbing situation, reverberating delicately off of tiles and whatnot. Officer Mann gave Mrs. Digsxby an embarrassed smile, as if to say, “That’s just his way, you know. A silly little fellow, but we love him,” as she awkwardly maneuvered around her even though there was plenty of space to enter like a normal person.

Francesca tried to show her guest to the morning room, but found herself following her to the kitchen/dining room. She said, “Can I get you anything? A glass of water perhaps, or a scone?”

Georgia took off her hat and trench coat and set them on the floor, carefully so that Francesca would have felt rude picking them up and hanging them where they belonged. Georgia sat down at the little dining table and let her hair down. She loosened her tie. She looked warmly at Francesca and said, “I’ll be asking the questions here.”
