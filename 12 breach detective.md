The beach detective arrived on the flying island.

**Evening, January 2**

"It's horrible," Georgia Mann, Unintuitive Detective,[@ I'm banking on that ol' "she's unintuitive so unintuitive things can happen in the story structure around her" thing] said to her husband, Florida Mann[@ This is a reference to [Florida Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Man)]. "Wright Heare has been killed!"

Ten minutes and six hours prior, twenty minutes after the killing, the beach detective leaned over the body he had discovered. *Poor sod,* he thought. He went through the body's pockets. An identification document. *Wright Heare? More like Wwrong... place wrong time. Heh. Nice one.* A folded folder[$ It was extra folded, more fold for your folder.]. He took it. For some reason, a martini glass had been drawn on it, in the exact square of paper that was face-up and towards him as he took it out of the pocket. It was a really nice ink sketch, actually. He unfolded the wad of paper and rapidly flicked through. Something about some guy named "Martin Eeny". Whatever. He pocketed it. He continued to search the body, but found nothing of interest. Besides, of course, the unconventional pattern of destruction of the body, which he had already noted.

"I'm sorry to hear that, dearest," said Florida. After a pause: "At least he presumably died doing what he loved: hearing things and then writing them down."[@ J came up with this underlying joke ~M]

"Yes... my behated[$ this was one of her nicknames for him]. I know he's up there writing what he hears in heaven, now.[$ heaven canonically exists in the flyingislandverse, btw[$ oddly enough, it's also a giant flying island. It just flies very high][$"interesting, interesting!" Wright Heare said in heaven, writing something down, having just interviewed a victim.][$ Every so often, someone would come down from heaven for some reason, and that's how they know it definitely exists for real for real.]]

"Naturally, the station immediately assigned me a new partner, for protection. Say hello to Wleft Theare."

"Oh, uh, hi,"

"Hello."

"Naturally, he's Wright Heare's identical twin brother."

"A brother... with a different last name?"

"Yes."

"And, of course, when he learned that Wleft Theare was coming along on this investigation, *his* identical twin brother, Wmiddle Yone, who is also a detective, insisted on coming along."

"Oh, uh, hello."

"Hi."

"Hello Wmiddle."

"Hello Wleft."

"Anyone else?"

"No."
