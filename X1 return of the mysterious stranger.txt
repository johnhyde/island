At Ithica.

I think beach detective has come to Ithica under false pretenses, possibly wassailing, possibly being their replacement piano tuner.

"Marvinlust Maoi? No, no, I'm... Cicisbeo Servente. [@ see, eg, https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cicisbeo / https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicisbeo] Yes."

"OK."

%%

He's wearing a felt, yellow sou'wester (which is thus of course useless for the rain)

%%

spousebreach (old term for adultery) — also spousebreech (Marvinlust is now wearing breechs as well)

In ciscisbeo chapter:
"contumely calumny" (possibly about the implication of spouse breach) (By the way, play on words with spouse breech somehow)
mr sleep-with-your-wife
Cat mummy’s catummy

I just had the thought: what if we see Reginald interact with Michaelmas Term at some point (like a flashback or whatever), and Michaelmas Term is the one guy on earth whom Reginald isn't constantly trying to double-outwit.

Could reginald possibly try to trick someone into sleeping with his wife, in a sort of "Paper Thin Hotel" kind of way? IDK seems kinda mean.
