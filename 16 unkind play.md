**Back in time to afternoon, January 2**

Florida Mann dandled his boys, Louis and Tex[@ their full names are canonically Louisiana and Texas, for obvious reasons ~J], upon his knees, making clopping noises with his mouth, as they flailed their arms about, as though lassoing cattle, perhaps even bison, or even mammothen, from their steeds. This was a favorite game of theirs recently. Usually it sparked an argument about which had lassoed a bigger or more numerous target, or how successfully, which nicely transitioned them into chasing each other about or wrestling or what-have-you. Louis, being two years older, had a natural advantage, but Tex quitted him like a Mann and made for a respectable opponent.

But on this afternoon, when Tex claimed to have lassoed 100 woolly mammoths in one go, Louis turned to his pop and said, “Pop, no one can lasso 100 woolly mammoths at once, can they?”

“I don’t suppose they can, although I’m not sure anyone’s ever tried,” replied Mr. Mann.

“What ‘bout a hunned hoses[^hoses]?” asked Tex in his cute little kid voice.

[^hoses]: This was his attempt at saying, “horses,” but he hadn’t yet mastered his tongue.

“I’d be very much surprised.” said Mr. Mann, “After all, that’s quite a lot of horses, and…” Florida Mann wasn’t sure it would be a good idea to continue, but he did: “I don’t expect a real cowboy would have much need to lasso more than a few of anything at once.”[$ In his heart of hearts he was pretty sure even two at once was simply not done.]

“POP, WHAT THE FLIP ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!” and “NOOOOOoooo…” and “this can’t be happening…” and “I didn’t figure you for a liar, Pop.” and “Why live?” and “I’m going to grow up and be a real cowboy and then I’ll show you!” were the sorts of things the Mann boys[$ Mann-children] were hollering at their father until they calmed down.

Then they went to the zoo to see a real cowboy in action.[$ The rodeo was attached to the zoo so they could have all the animal stuff in one place, and people didn’t really distinguish too much between the two. This led to exciting new developments like giraffe wrangling and penguin tag.[$ Penguin tag involves humans trying to capture penguins by hand. If the penguin makes it into the water, it’s generally considered to have won, although some brave sportsmen have been observed to dive in, skates and all!]]

Prudence’s alert, almost military posture as she regarded the cavortings before her belied her true purpose in attending: leisure. It was her day off, and she needed something to distract her from certain things[^things] which were distracting her from her natural state, which she assumed to be peaceful, contented, and subduèdly cheerful, so she had come to the zoo.

[^things]: Wouldn’t you like to know!

And so she regarded the cavortings of some trained mountain goats, who were bouncing to and fro on the constructed rocky terrain of the enclosure, while costumed human co-cavorters ran about between the goats and gave the impression that the whole thing was more choreographed than the goats alone could convincingly demonstrate. Prudence wasn’t sure whether to clap, boo, or laugh. It wasn’t really clear whether the performance was supposed to be taken seriously. The yodelers seemed pretty serious, for their part, but some of the goatskinned lederhosened boys were smirking, which inclined Prudence also to smirk.

She was about to turn and seek out another spectacle when she felt something unexpected come over her—a loop of rope which fell and tightened around her midriff, pinning her arms to her sides just above the elbows. Juvenile hoots and hollers mingled with loud grownup scolding in the crisp air, drowning out her initial squeaks of alarm. She turned to see a man and two boys fighting for control of the end of the rope which bound her. She tried wiggle out of it by herself, but her thick winter coat made this difficult, as did the constant yanking in the line.

Eventually, Florida Mann gave up and walked over to Prudence with a drawn knife. Her eyes widened. Rationally, she believed this stranger was simply a normal guy[^normal] with unruly sons who was about to cut her loose. On the other hand, she’d just been ambushed and tied up, and found the oncoming blade unsettling.

[^normal]: He's just a normal Mann! He's just an innocent Mann![@ this is a [reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF7_tlg6hHk) because this video is very funny ~J]

Mr. Mann wasn’t really thinking about how his knife might seem, and while he tried to maintain a soothing patter of reassurances and apologies, he found her frozen, wide-eyed stare unsettling. As he stepped within cutting range of the loop, Prudence stepped back. He presented the knife, as though to say, “Nothing to be afraid of, I’m only going to cut the rope,” at which she stepped back again, lost her balance, and fell against the plastic pane which separated her from the goats, et al.

Johann Deller[@ “Yo” Deller, for short], one of the yodelers, heard the thud of Prudence’s misstep, saw the Mann with the knife, advancing, and interrupted his yodeling to shriek in terror. His fellow yodelers, easily startled, also began to shriek. The goats took this as their cue to break ranks, such as they were, and their frolicking became more chaotic and aggressive. A few of the human frolickers found in this their own reasons to shriek. The goats may have been shrieking as well. In short, Prudence found herself in a very alarming situation.

[$ BUT AREN'T YOU WONDERING *WHERE* THAT LASSO CAME FROM? NO? TOO BAD ~M]

**About 5 minutes earlier.**

"Any you're sure you're a real cowboy? ... Mr Maoi?" asked Florida.[$Florida Mann was, as luck would have it, a distant direct descendant of Tramar Lacel Dillard. Not this was in any way relevant to the situation at hand.]

"Yep, absolutely," said "Marvinlust Maoi", who was wearing a cowboy hat in addition to his usual get-up. "Root them toot them. Get a dog little longies. Et-cetera, and so on."

"You wouldn't just happen to have stumbled into this zoödeo and put on this hat as a foolproof disguise as you, say, aim to slip through Skoiosian society undetected, like a mist in the fog in the night, or anything like that?" asked Florida Mann.

"... 'No'." said cowboy marvinlust.

"Oh, good," said Florida. "In that case, my boys and I have a question for you."

"Shoot." said the 'cowboy'. "By which I mean: go ahead and ask. In cowboy parlance. Iddy-gup!"

"Right... so... how many things would you say you've lassoed at the same time."

"Shoot." said the 'cowboy'. "By which I mean: an exclamation or interjection, probably a bowdlerized version of the standard interjection refering to excrement.[@ This is sort of written like I'm quoting a dictionary, but I just spat it from the dome. Y'all.] In cowboy parlance. Yee to the haw! Probably, like, I don't know, um, 16?"

"Really? 16 at once?" asked Florida, incredulity in his voice.

"Perhaps I do not understand the nature of the question," said 'Marvinlust', still doing his cowboy voice. "But, here: you and your little varmits (in cowboy terms this means critters, and I'm refering to your fine young sons here[$perhaps even... Wright Here?[$no]]) go right ahead and try." he handed them a lasso, and promptly walked off.

"Whoa!" and "Cooool!" said the boys.

**Evening, January 2, just after it was determined that there was no one else to be introduced**

The Manns heard a knock on the door. “I’ll get it,” said Wleft Theare and Wmiddle Yone in unison. Then they said, “Jinx! Double Jinx!” and so on, while Florida got up to answer the door.

“Ah, good evening, Miss Wellesley[@ I asked my mom to come up with a last name for Prudence and this is what I got ~J]! I’m so glad you could join us for dinner,” he said, seeing Prudence on his doorstep.
