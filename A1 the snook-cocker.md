Cocking a snook at the Parmenidean deity who bids him to turn from negation as ungraspable

(Though - that being said - what if the "two routes" of Parmenides are the respective charms of male and female genitals?)

Wth


Ugh, gay

Look at his lugubrious mien

I cock a snook at such dilettantish occasionalism


I could prop on his itious

> He is come to cock my snook
> but, verily,
> 'tis I who will snook his cock!
—_Upstart Crow_


who up cocking they snook


I cock my snook at thee, villain wordingbook!

From Hell's cock, I snook at thee!


Speaking of which have any of you guys seen my snook


Your snook has snuck off


Oh damn

Oh I hope it doesn't get cocked

That's the last thing I need


Your snook snuck off, a snack to snag.

Cocked it was, and now you’re cooked

Or perhaps cucked?


Cucked By My Own Snook

By Chuck Tingle


My snook was cocked; snuck in the cooker

My cock was snooked, cucked playing snooker


Oh, that sneaker of a snook! Snicker-snack it was struck — smacked! Clocked by a cock.


Jeff Koons cocked his snook backwards


Chuck cooked his snook-cucking book, rooking the buyers 

(Brooke had bought the book for big bucks at Borders; sickened by the sucky story, she chucked the book like a brick at Chuck’s back, breaking it and bringing him to the brink.) 


Zounds! Koons cocked snook crook'd; c'rupt crypt trip trick knows no bounds.


That might just be the scurvy talking, though.

Might just be the unnatural amount of times I've been repeating the phrase "cocking my snook" to myself this afternoon.


Careful you don't repeat that in the wrong part of town

"sure, honey, I can cock your snook, it's another twenty bucks, or a pack of smokes"


Damn! Did this in the meaner part of town and heard the offer: "Cock your snook for a dollar?"

Who up packing they smokes

If you're over thirty and your circle isn't talking about:

  • Cocking they snook


It's a shame that when that guy killed Snook in those Star Wars films he didn't say "looks like I've cocked my last Snook!"
